Location is everything:
This script's directory is automatically added to sys.path,
so having this script in the same directory as RO and TUI
makes those packages available without setting PYTHONPATH.

History:
2004-05-17 ROwen    Bug fix: automatic ftp hung due to import lock contention,
                    because execution was part of importing.
                    Fixed by first importing TUI.Main and then running the app.

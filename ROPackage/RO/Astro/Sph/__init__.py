Astronomical math in spherical coordinates.
Most coordinate conversions are in the Cnv package,
which works in cartesian coordinates. Hence to
apply a conversion in spherical coordinates
you must convert to cartesian and back, e.g.:
toPos = scFromCC(Cnv.geoFromICRS(ccFromSC(fromPos)))

Conventions used in Sph:
- Spherical coordinates are listed
  with the equatorial angle first, hence:
  (RA, Dec), (Long, Lat), (Az, Alt).
- Angles are in degrees.
- The sign convention for altitude is
  0 to the south, 90 to the east (which is right handed).

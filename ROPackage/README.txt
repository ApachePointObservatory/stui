Various utilities written, adapted or borrowed by Russell Owen

Prerequisites:
- Python (2.3 or later) with Tkinter
- numpy
- pyfits (1.1 or later; used only by RO.DS9)
- setuputils (for easier installation)

Note: RO version 2.1 is the first version to use numpy instead of numarray and Numeric.

Installation:

The usual technique works:
% python setup.py install

Or if you don't have sufficient permissions, try this:
% python setup.py build
% sudo python setup.py install

Notes:
- Written with cross-platform portability in mind. It has been written on
   MacOS X and has been tested on some flavors of unix and on Windows.
- The code is presently pure python, though that may not always be so.
- This code is provided "as is". Much of the code is quite well tested
  and is used daily, but some is not.
- I cannot provide much technical support but am always happy to receive
  bug reports and patches.

which contains some algorithms developed by Patrik Wallace and requires
payment for commercial use.

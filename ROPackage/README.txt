*** Prerequisites ***

- Python (2.3 or later) with Tkinter
- numpy
- pyfits (1.1 or later; used only by RO.DS9)
- setuputils (for easier installation)

*** Installation ***

If you have easy_install (you may have to use sudo or run as root):
% easy_install RO
or manually download it from PyPI and run:
% python setup.py install

Or, since RO is pure python, you can just copy it to site-packages.

*** Notes ***

- The code is presently pure python, though that may not always be so.
- This code is provided "as is". Much of the code is quite well tested
  and is used daily, but some is not.
- I cannot provide much technical support but am always happy to receive
  bug reports and patches.

For more information see the manuals in the docs directory.

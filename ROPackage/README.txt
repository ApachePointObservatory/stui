Various utilities written, adapted or borrowed by Russell Owen

Prerequisites:
- Python 2.3 with Tkinter
- Numeric (for RO.Astro only)
- numarray
- pyfits (for RO.DS9 only)

I hope to transition from Numeric and numarray
to numpy around mid-2007.

Installation:

The usual technique works:
% python setup.py install

Or if you don't have sufficient permissions, try this:
% python setup.py build
% sudo python setup.py install

Notes:
- Written with cross-platform portability in mind (with one known exception, see next item). It has been written on MacOS X and has been tested on some flavors of unix and on Windows.
- Written in pure python (at least for now). I may add compiled extensions at some point.
- This code is provided "as is". Much of the code is quite well tested and is used daily, but some of it is not.
- I cannot provide much technical support, but am always happy to receive bug reports and would be interested to learn of your enhancements.

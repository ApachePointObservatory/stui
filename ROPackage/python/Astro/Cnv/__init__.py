Astronomical math, including numerous coordinate conversions,
in cartesian coordinates.

Unless otherwise noted, the following conventions are used:
- Distances are in au (astronomical units)
- Angles are in degrees

Most of this code is based on algorithms developed by Pat Wallace.

This Software is made available free of charge for use by:
a) private individuals for non-profit research; and
b) non-profit educational, academic and research institutions.
Commercial use is prohibited without making separate arrangements
with Pat Wallace and me. Contact me for more information.

This software is supplied "as is" and without technical support.
However, I do appreciate notification of bugs.

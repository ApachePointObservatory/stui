"""TCP specializations of TkSocket.

All permit disconnection and reconnection
and the base class offers support for
authorization and line-oriented output.

Requirements:
- Tkinter (due to the underlying TkSocket library)

History:
2002-11-22 R Owen: first version with history. Moved to RO.Comm
    and modified to use TkSocket sockets. This fixed a pitfall
    (it was not safe to close the socket if a read handler
    was present) and socket writes are done in a background thread
    and so no longer block.
2002-12-13 ROwen    Moved isConnected from VMSTelnet to TCPConnection.
2003-02-27 ROwen    Added setStateCallback; added connection state.
    Overhauled connection subroutine handling: you can now have multiple
    connection subroutines, they receive the new connection state variable
    and an explanatory message.
    Overhauled VMSTelnet to use this instead of printing negotation status directly.
2003-07-18 ROwen    Renamed subroutine to function, for consistency with other code;
    improved doc strings (including adding a doc string to NullConnection).
2003-10-13 ROwen    Major overhaul to match new TkSocket and simplify subclasses.
2003-11-19 ROwen    Bug fix: reason was not always a string; modified _setState
                    to cast it to a string.
2003-12-04 ROwen    Modified to only call the state callback when the state
                    or reason changes.
                    Changed doCall to callNow in addStateCallback,
                    for consistency with other addCallback functions.
2004-05-18 ROwen    Stopped importing string, Tkinter, RO.Alg and RO.Wdg; they weren't used.
2004-07-13 ROwen    Modified for overhauled TkSocket.
2004-09-14 ROwen    Importing socket module but not using it.
2004-10-12 ROwen    Corrected documentation for addReadCallback and addStateCallback.
2005-06-08 ROwen    Changed TCPConnection to a new-style class.
2005-08-10 ROwen    Modified for TkSocket state constants as class const, not module const.
2005-08-11 ROwen    Added isDone and getProgress methods.
2008-01-23 ROwen    Removed getProgress method. It was clumsy and better handled by the user.
                    Modified connect to raise RuntimeError if:
                    - host and self.host are both blank. Formerly it disconnected the socket.
                    - already connected. Formerly it disconnected (without waiting for that to finish)
                    and then connected. That was two operations, which made it hard to track completion.
2008-01-25 ROwen    Tweaked connect to raise RuntimeError if connecting or connected (not just connected).
2008-02-13 ROwen    Added mayConnect method.

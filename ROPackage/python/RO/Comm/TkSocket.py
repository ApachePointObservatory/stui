"""Sockets optimized for use with Tkinter GUIs.

TkSocket allows nonblocking event-driven operation:
- Connection and disconnection are done in the background.
- You may begin writing as soon as you start connecting.
- Written data is queued and sent as the connection permits.
- The read and readLine methods are nonblocking.
- You may specify a read callback, which is called when data is available,
  and a state callback, which is called when the connection state changed.

History:
2002-11-22 ROwen    First version
2003-02-25 ROwen    Bug fix: could hang on program exit; cured using atexit;
                    also added a __del__ method for the same reason.
2003-02-27 ROwen    _WriteThread.close was printing an error message
                    instead of terminating the write thread.
2003-04-04 ROwen    Bug fix: BasicSocket was being set to a function instead of a type;
                    this failed under Windows (hanks to Craig Loomis for report and fix).
2003-05-01 ROwen    Modified to work with Python 2.3b1 (which does not support
                    _tkinter.create/deletefilehandler); thanks to Martin v. Lowis for the fix.
2003-10-13 ROwen    Overhauled to more robust and to prevent delays while connecting.
                    Also added support for monitoring state.
2003-10-14 ROwen    Bug fix: close while NotConnected caused perpetual Closing state.
2003-11-19 ROwen    Bug fix: reason was not always a string; modified _setState
                    to cast it to a string.
2003-12-04 ROwen    Modified to only call the state callback when the state or reason changes.
2004-05-18 ROwen    Increased state polling delay from 100ms to 200ms.
                    Stopped importing sys since it was not being used.
2004-07-21 ROwen    Overhauled to add Windows compatibility, by eliminating the use
                    of createfilehandler. Modified to use tcl sockets,
                    eliminating all use of threads. Visible changes include:
                    - TCP/IP is the only type of socket.
                    - The socket is connected when it is created.
                    - The read callback no longer receives the data read;
                      call read or readLine as appropriate.
                    - The state Closing is gone; when a socket begins closing
                      the state is set to Closed and there is no way to tell
                      when the close finishes (due to limitations in tcl sockets)
                    - Any data queued for write is written before closing finishes.
2004-10-12 ROwen    Fixed documentation for setReadCallback.
                    Removed class attribute _tkWdg since it was not being used.
2005-06-08 ROwen    Changed TkSocket and NullSocket to new-style classes.
2005-06-14 ROwen    Modified to clear references to the following when the socket closes,
                    to aid garbage collection:
                    - read and state callback functions
                    - pointer to the tk socket
                    - pointer to a string var and its _tk
2005-06-16 ROwen    Removed an unused variable (caught by pychecker).
2005-08-05 ROwen    Modified to use _tk.call instead of _tk.eval for config (because I expect it to
                    handle quoting arguments better and I was able to cut down the number of calls).
2005-08-10 ROwen    Bug fix: was not sending binary data through correctly.
                    Fixed by using _tk.call instead of _tk.eval to write.
                    Modified to use call instead of eval in all cases.
                    Added TkServerSocket and TkBaseSocket.
                    Changed state constants from module constants to class constants.
2005-08-22 ROwen    TkSocket: bug fix: an exception could occur in the read
                    callback if the remote host closed the connection.
                    Formerly the internal socket read callback tried to check
                    the connection before calling the user's read callback,
                    but that test could fail due to timing issues.
                    Now the user's read callback is always called
                    and read and readLine always return "" (or default for readLine)
                    if the socket is closed -- they never raise an exception.
                    Bug fix: Bug fix: _TkCallback was creating a tk function name
                    that was not necessarily unique, which could lead to subtle bugs
                    (tk not being calling some callback functions).
                    Eliminated the unused self._tkVar.
2005-08-24 ROwen    Bug fix: leaked tcl functions.
                    Modified to use TkUtil.TclFunc instead of an local _TkCallback.
2006-07-10 ROwen    Modified BaseServer to be compatible with Python 2.3.
                    Added BaseServer to __all__.
                    Bug fix: invalid import in test code.
2008-01-16 ROwen    TkSocket: added pre-test for socket existing to write and writeLine.
2008-03-06 ROwen    Stopped setting instance variable _prevLine; it was not used anywhere.

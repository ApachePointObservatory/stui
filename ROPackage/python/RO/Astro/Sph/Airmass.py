def airmass (alt):
    """Computes the airmass at a given altitude.
    
    Inputs:
    - alt   the observed altitude, as affected by refraction (deg)
    
    Returns an estimate of the air mass, in units of that at the zenith.

    Warnings:   
    - Alt < _MinAlt is treated as _MinAlt to avoid arithmetic overflow.

    Adapted from AIRMAS by Pat Wallace, whose notes follow:
    
    Uses Hardie's (1962) polynomial fit to Bemporad's data for
    the relative air mass, X, in units of thickness at the zenith
    as tabulated by Schoenberg (1929). This is adequate for all
    normal needs as it is accurate to better than 0.1% up to X =
    6.8 and better than 1% up to X = 10. Bemporad's tabulated
    values are unlikely to be trustworthy to such accuracy
    because of variations in density, pressure and other
    conditions in the atmosphere from those assumed in his work.

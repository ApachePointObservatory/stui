"""Math utilities by Russell Owen

History:
2001-01-10 ROwen    Removed inf and nan stuff because it fails on Mac OS X
                    (and it was known to not work on all platforms).
                    Maybe someday Python will handle IEEE floating point!
2002-03-04 ROwen    Added checkRange.
2002-07-09 ROwen    Added compareFloats, matchLists and flattenList.
2002-08-01 ROwen    Renamed logEQ to logEq for consistency.
2002-08-08 ROwen    Moved to RO and renamed from ROMath.
2002-08-13 ROwen    Bug fix: wrapCtr gave the wrong result.
2003-03-12 ROwen    Added isSequence; rewrote flattenList to use it.
2003-04-01 ROwen    Added rot2D.
2003-05-29 ROwen    Added asList.
2003-06-27 ROwen    Added removeDups.
2003-07-18 ROwen    Added asSequence.
2003-11-18 ROwen    Moved asList, asSequence, flattenLists, isSequence,
                    removeDups and matchLists to SeqUtil.
2007-04-24 ROwen    Changed Numeric to numpy in a doc string.

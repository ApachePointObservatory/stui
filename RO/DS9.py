Interface for viewing images with the ds9 image viewer.
Loosely based on XPA, by Andrew Williams.

For more information, see the XPA Access Points section
of the ds9 reference manual (under Help in ds9).

WARNING: this module is not fully with Windows using ds9 3.0.3 with xpa 2.1.5.
There appears to be a bug in ds9 or xpa that makes showArray inoperable.
Symptoms suggest that the array data is undergoing newline translation.
See <http://www.astro.washington.edu/rowen/ds9andxpa.html> for more information.

Requirements:

*** Unix Requirements
- ds9 and xpa must be installed somewhere on your $PATH

*** MacOS X Requirements
- The ds9 MacOS X application (ds9.app) in ~/Applications or /Applications
  or the ds9 unix application somewhere on the $PATH
- if xpa is not yet part of the ds9 MacOS X application bundle,
  then xpaget, etc. must be installed as unix executables somewhere on the path.
  Currently if you download the darwin binaries, simply put xpaget, etc.
  somewhere on your path; /usr/local/bin is traditional,
  but you may have to create it and and modify your .login to include it on $PATH.

*** Windows Requirements
- Mark Hammond's pywin32 package: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>
- ds9 installed in the default directory C:\Program Files\ds9\
  (the default location)
- xpa installed in either the default directory C:\Program Files\xpa\
  or in C:\Program Files\ds9\
- Mark Hammonds pywin32 package: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>
- ds9 installed in the default directory C:\Program Files\ds9\
  (the default location)
- xpa installed in either the default directory C:\Program Files\xpa\
  or in C:\Program Files\ds9\

Extra Keyword Arguments:
Many commands take additional keywords as arguments. These are sent
as separate commands after the main command is executed.
Useful keywords for viewing images include: scale, orient and zoom.
See the XPA Access Points section of the ds9 reference manual
for more information. Note that the value of each keyword
is sent as an unquoted string. If you want quotes, provide them
as part of the value string.

Template Argument:
The template argument allows you to specify which copy of ds9
or which other software you wish to command via xpa.
One common use is to have multiple copies of ds9 on your own machine
(often necessary because ds9 only has one window, grr).
If you launch ds9 with the -title command-line option then you can
send commands to that ds9 by using that title as the template.
See the XPA documentation for other uses for template, such as talking
to ds9 on a remote host.

History:
2004-04-15 ROwen	First release.
2004-04-20 ROwen	showarry improvements:
					- Accepts any array whose values can be represented as signed ints.
					- Bug fix: x and y dimensions were swapped (#@$@# numarray)
2004-04-29 ROwen	Added xpaset function.
2004-05-05 ROwen	Added DS9Win class and moved the showXXX functions to it.
					Added function xpaget.
					Added template argument to xpaset.
2004-10-15 ROwen	Bug fix: could only communicate with one ds9;
					fixed by specifying port=0 when opening ds9.
2004-11-02 ROwen	Improved Mac compatibility (now looks in [~]/Applications).
					Made compatible with Windows, except showArray is broken;
					this appears to be a bug in ds9 3.0.3.
					loadFITSFile no longer tests the file name's extension.
					showArray now handles most array types without converting the data.
					Eliminated showBinFile because I could not get it to work;
					this seems to be an bug or documentation bug in ds9.
					Changed order of indices for 3-d images from (y,x,z) to (z,y,x).
2004-11-17 ROwen	Corrected a bug in the subprocess version of xpaget.
					Updated header comments for big-fixed version of subprocess.
2004-12-01 ROwen	Bug fix in xpaset: terminate data with \n if not already done.
					Modified to use subprocess module (imported from RO.Future
					if Python is old enough not to include it).
					Added __all__.
2004-12-13 ROwen	Bug fix in DS9Win; the previous version was missing
					the code that waited for DS9 to launch.
2005-05-16 ROwen	Added doRaise argument to xpaget, xpaset and DS9Win;
					the default is False so the default behavior has changed.
2005-09-23 ROwen	Bug fix: used the warnings module without importing it.

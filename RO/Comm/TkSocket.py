"""Enhanced sockets optimized for use with Tkinter GUIs.

TkSocket allows completely nonblocking operations:
- Connection and disconnection is done in the background.
- You may begin writing as soon as you start connecting.
- Written data is queued and sent as the connection permits.
- When data is available to be read. a read callback function is called.

Also, state changes can easily be monitored via a state callback function.

History:
2002-11-22 ROwen	First version
2003-02-25 ROwen	Bug fix: could hang on program exit; cured using atexit;
					also added a __del__ method for the same reason.
2003-02-27 ROwen	_WriteThread.close was printing an error message
					instead of terminating the write thread.
2003-04-04 ROwen	Bug fix: BasicSocket was being set to a function instead of a type;
					this failed under Windows (hanks to Craig Loomis for report and fix).
2003-05-01 ROwen	Modified to work with Python 2.3b1 (which does not support
					_tkinter.create/deletefilehandler); thanks to Martin v. Lowis for the fix.
2003-10-13 ROwen	Overhauled to more robust and to prevent delays while connecting.
					Also added support for monitoring state.
2003-10-14 ROwen	Bug fix: close while NotConnected caused perpetual Closing state.
2003-11-19 ROwen	Bug fix: reason was not always a string; modified _setState
					to cast it to a string.
2003-12-04 ROwen	Modified to only call the state callback when the state or reason changes.
2004-05-18 ROwen	Increased state polling delay from 100ms to 200ms.
					Stopped importing sys since it was not being used.
2004-07-21 ROwen	Overhauled to add Windows compatibility, by eliminating the use
					of createfilehandler. Modified to use tcl sockets,
					eliminating all use of threads. Visible changes include:
					- TCP/IP is the only type of socket.
					- The socket is connected when it is created.
					- The read callback no longer receives the data read;
					  call read or readLine as appropriate.
					- The state Closing is gone; when a socket begins closing
					  the state is set to Closed and there is no way to tell
					  when the close finishes (due to limitations in tcl sockets)
					- Any data queued for write is written before closing finishes.
2004-10-12 ROwen	Fixed documentation for setReadCallback.
					Removed class attribute _tkWdg since it was not being used.
2005-06-08 ROwen	Changed TkSocket and NullSocket to new-style classes.
2005-06-14 ROwen	Modified to clear references to the following when the socket closes,
					to aid garbage collection:
					- read and state callback functions
					- pointer to the tk socket
					- pointer to a string var and its _tk

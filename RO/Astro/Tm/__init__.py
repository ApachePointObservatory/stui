"""Time routines for Astronomy

The heart of these routines is software written by Pat Wallace.
I have converted his code and algorithms from FORTRAN to Python
and added my own code.

This Software is made available free of charge for use by:
a) private individuals for non-profit research; and
b) non-profit educational, academic and research institutions.
Commercial use is prohibited without making separate arrangements
with Pat Wallace and me. Contact me for more information.

This software is supplied "as is" and without technical support.
However, I do appreciate notification of bugs.

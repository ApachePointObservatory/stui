"""RO.Wdg.Toplevel wdigets are windows with some enhanced functionality, including:
- Remembers last position if closed or iconified
- Can record position and visiblity in a file

History:
2002-03-18 ROwen	First release.
2002-04-29 ROwen	Added "ToplevelSet".
2002-04-30 ROwen	Added wdgFunc argument to Toplevel.
2003-03-21 ROwen	Changed to allow resizable = True/False;
					fixed a bug wherein	geometry strings with +- or -+ were being rejected;
					added Debug constant for more robust launching.
2003-03-25 ROwen	Added ability to create geom file if none exists
2003-06-18 ROwen	Modified to print at traceback and go on when the toplevel's widget
					function fails; the test now excludes SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
2003-06-19 ROwen	Now saves window open/closed.
2003-11-18 ROwen	Modified to use SeqUtil instead of MathUtil.
2003-12-18 ROwen	Size is now saved and restored for windows with only one axis resizable.
					Changed getGeometry to always return the entire geometry string.
2004-02-23 ROwen	Preference files are now read with universal newline support
					on Python 2.3 or later.
2004-03-05 ROwen	Modified to use RO.OS.univOpen.
2004-05-18 ROwen	Bug fix in ToplevelSet: referred to defGeomFixDict instead of defGeomVisDict.
2004-07-16 ROwen	Modified Toplevel to propogate the exception if wdgFunc fails.
					As a result, ToplevelSet.createToplevel no longer creates an erroneous
					entry to a nonexistent toplevel if wdgFunc fails.
					Bug fix: ToplevelSet could not handle toplevels that were destroyed.
					Various methods modified to use getToplevel(name) to get the tl,
					and if None is returned then the tl never existed or has been destroyed.
2004-08-11 ROwen	Renamed Close... constants to tl_Close...
					Define __all__ to restrict import.
2005-06-08 ROwen	Changed ToplevelSet to a new-style class.
2005-10-18 ROwen	Fixed doc error: width, height ignored only if not resizable in that dir.
2006-04-26 ROwen	Added a patch (an extra call to update_idletasks) for a bug in Tcl/Tk 8.4.13
					that caused certain toplevels to be displayed in the wrong place.
					Removed a patch in makeVisible for an older tk bug; the patch
					was now causing iconified toplevels to be left iconified.
					Always pack the widget with expand="yes", fill="both";
					this helps the user creates a window first and then makes it resizable.
					Commented out code in makeVisible that supposedly avoids toplevels shifting;
					I can't see how it can help.

		An alternative solution is to create a variant of GenericCallback that

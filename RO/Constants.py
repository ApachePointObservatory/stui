"""Constants for the RO package, especially RO.Wdg.

Supplies the following constants:

For widgets displaying data differently depending on state:
- Normal
- Warning
- Error

Functions to get and set the base url (prefix) for url help
(these are not imported with from ... import *
since they are mainly used internally to RO.Wdg):
- _joinHelpURL
- _setHelpURLBase

History:
2004-08-11 ROwen	Split out from RO.Wdg.Label and RO.Wdg.CtxMenu.
					Add sev prefix to state constants.
2004-09-02 ROwen	Moved to RO.Constants to solve circular import problems.
2005-01-05 ROwen	Changed st_Normal, to sevNormal, etc.

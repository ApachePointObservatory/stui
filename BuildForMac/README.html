<h2>BuildForMac README</h2>

<p>This directory contains scripts to build a TUI double-clickable application for Panther (MacOS X 10.3) from source.

<p>To build TUI for MacOS X from source follow these <a href="../TUI/Help/InstallationOnMac.html">installation instructions</a>. Note: these instructions also apply to Jaguar (MacOS X 10.2), but the scripts in this directory are not used and you do not get a double-clickable application.

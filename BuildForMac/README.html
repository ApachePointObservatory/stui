<h2>BuildForMac README</h2>

<p>To build a TUI double-clickable application for MacOS X 10.3 or 10.4:<pre>
% python setup.py [--quiet] py2app
</pre>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
	<li>Requires py2app, available from <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">http://pythonmac.org/packages/</a>.
	<li>If you build TUI on MacOS 10.4, it will only run on 10.3 if you used 3rd party python additions (such as numarray) that were built on MacOS X 10.3. Such packages can be found at <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">http://pythonmac.org/packages/</a>, listed as for "MacOS X 10.3+".
</ul>

"""The Python portion of the script that builds TUI

To use, at the Terminal type:
  ./buildtui.sh
or:
  python buildtui.py

Note: the reason this is not self-contained (is run by buildtui.sh
instead of simply ./buildtui.py) is an obscure bug that causes
the self-contained version to build a non-working application on my system
(this seems to be related to my having unix-X11 build of python
in /usr/local/bin/python). Rather than risking non-functional builds,
I keep the shell script around.

History:
2004-02-20 ROwen	Specify libs in buildapp instead of as cmd-line args.
					Stop forcing in the "os" module since that's no longer needed.
					Use USE_ZIPIMPORR=False instead of unpacking Modules.zip.
2004-03-03 ROwen	Modified to use the new runtui.py as the main program.
2004-08-23 ROwen	Modified to save the source for built-in scripts.
2004-09-09 ROwen	Bug fix: was not including the tcl snack package.
2004-10-06 ROwen	Modified to include version info in the proper way.
					Hence also modified to stop including it in the file name.
2004-11-19 ROwen	Modified to use current RO and TUI instead of one on the
					PYTHONPATH, to avoid importing svn stuff.
2005-03-03 ROwen	Modified to import the new RO/Wdg/Resources.
2005-08-02 ROwen	Modified for the new TUI layout that allows the python code
					to be zipped and separated from resources.
2005-09-22 ROwen	Added TUI/Scripts to the list of resources.

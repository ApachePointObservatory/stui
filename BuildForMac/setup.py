"""The Python portion of the script that builds TUI

Usage:
% python setup.py [--quiet] py2app

Note: as of 2010-07-21 the resulting application failed at startup
with a complaint in the log file about zope.interface not being available.
I fixed this by adding an empty __init__.py file to the zope directory in site-packages
(after trying various fixes in this file that did not work).
This is with Python 2.6, zope.interface 3.6.1 and py2app 0.4.3.

History:
2004-02-20 ROwen    Specify libs in buildapp instead of as cmd-line args.
                    Stop forcing in the "os" module since that's no longer needed.
                    Use USE_ZIPIMPORR=False instead of unpacking Modules.zip.
2004-03-03 ROwen    Modified to use the new runtui.py as the main program.
2004-08-23 ROwen    Modified to save the source for built-in scripts.
2004-09-09 ROwen    Bug fix: was not including the tcl snack package.
2004-10-06 ROwen    Modified to include version info in the proper way.
                    Hence also modified to stop including it in the file name.
2004-11-19 ROwen    Modified to use current RO and TUI instead of one on the
                    PYTHONPATH, to avoid importing svn stuff.
2005-03-03 ROwen    Modified to import the new RO/Wdg/Resources.
2005-08-02 ROwen    Modified for the new TUI layout that allows the python code
                    to be zipped and separated from resources.
2005-09-22 ROwen    Added TUI/Scripts to the list of resources.
2006-01-21 ROwen    Renamed from buildtui.py to setup.py.
                    Modified to use py2app.
2006-02-24 ROwen    Modified to include matplotlib.
                    Added addDataFiles.
2006-03-08 ROwen    Modified to use new runtuiWithLog.py instead of runtui.py.
2006-05-25 ROwen    Added module FileDialog so the NICFPS:Focus script loads.
2006-06-01 ROwen    Corrected location of matplotlib data files.
2006-09-08 ROwen    Modified for py2app version 0.3.4 (which requires setuptools
                    and handles matplotlib automatically).
                    Added UniversalBinaryOK constant.
2006-12-01 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK to True, due to universal Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.14.
2006-12-28 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK back to False; Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.14 is buggy.
2007-01-16 ROwen    Added email.Utils to required modules (needed for Python 2.5).
2007-01-30 ROwen    Modified unused resource-adding code to support new RO layout.
2007-06-07 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK to True, due to universal Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.15.
2007-09-10 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK back to False due to the bugs in Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.15
                    (color picker broken and window geometry wrong on MacOS X 10.3.9)
2007-10-01 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK back to True, due to universal Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.16.
                    The color picker is fixed, but window geometry is still bad under MacOS X 10.3.9.
2007-11-08 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK back to False due to the bugs in Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.16
                    (nasty memory leak)
2007-12-20 ROwen    Bug fix: always built a universal binary on Intel Macs (regardless of UniversalBinaryOK).
2008-01-14 ROwen    Changed UniversalBinaryOK back to True. Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.4.14 does have the problem
                    of losing the mouse pointer, but with the improved guider control-click
                    and 8.4.15-8.4.17 have a nasty memory leak and may be the last 8.4.x produced.
2008-01-29 ROwen    Modified to put tcl snack in a new location that is now supported by runtuiWithLog.py
                    and no longer requires that the Tcl/Tk Framework be installed.
                    Other tweaks to better support not including the Tcl/Tk Framework.
2009-11-09 ROwen    Removed installation of snack (now that TUI uses pygame to play sounds).
                    Modified to use TUI.Version.ApplicationName.
2010-07-21 ROwen    Removed email.Utils and FileDialog from inclModules;
                    the former is forbidden in Python 2.6 and the latter is not needed.

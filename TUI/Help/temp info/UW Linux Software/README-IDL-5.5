Notes:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTES UPDATED JANUARY 27, 2003 to include reference to the /net/idllib
directory
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


User environment setup:

 setenv IDL_DIR /net/idl
 setenv LIB /net/idllib
 setenv IDL_STARTUP $HOME/idl/idl_startup.pro

Run from a regular xterm, not a schmancy KDE or Gnome terminal, if you
want arrow keys to work for command recall and editing.

Alternately, you can add the following to your idl_startup.pro file:

DEFINE_KEY, ESC=string([27B, 79B, 68B]), 'ALT_L', /BACK_CHAR
DEFINE_KEY, ESC=string([27B, 79B, 67B]), 'ALT_R', /FORWARD_CHAR
DEFINE_KEY, ESC=string([27B, 79B, 65B]), 'ALT_UP', /PREVIOUS_LINE
DEFINE_KEY, ESC=string([27B, 79B, 66B]), 'ALT_DN', /NEXT_LINE

	------------------------------


Libraries of IDL functions are available in /net/idllib.  DO NOT USE
the versions on BLUEMOON.  THERE IS ***NOTHING*** interesting on
bluemoon.

Use the following syntax to include IDL libraries in your IDL path:

  !path=!path+':'+expand_path('+/net/idllib/astron/pro')

I can not vouch for the provenance of any of these libraries, but
folks use them every day with good results.

	------------------------------


To get IDL to redraw the graphics window after being covered up by
another window, execute the following command once per idl session (or
put it in an idl startup file).

IDL> device, retain = 2

To have idl behave as though it were using an 8 bit, pseudo color
display when in fact it is using a true color, 24 bit display, execute
the following once per session (or put it in a startup file):

IDL> device, decomposed = 0

This is recommended, in particular, if you want to use the predefined
IDL color tables accessed with the LOADCT command. Note that you will
have to redisplay your graphics after you make any changes to the
color table in order for the changes to be visible. You can set the
decomposed keyword to 1 (the default) at any time to use the IDL
features designed for a 24 bit display.

There seems to be a problem with the above when IDL is using direct
color displays. In order to force IDL us use the true color visual
class, execute the following BEFORE YOU USE ANY GRAPHICS in an IDL
session (or put it in a startup file):

IDL> device, true_color = 24 


=======================================================================

You can use our license to run IDL on MS Windows computers.  Download
the software distribution from http://www.rsinc.com/download/, follow
the installation instructions, and copy the contents of
/net/idl/license.dat into the installation form when asked for your
license info.

If you want to run IDL under MacOS, you need to purchase a single-user
license and a USB HASP license device for $25.

=======================================================================

We *PAY FOR* a 25 seat floating license for IDL via a university
purchase agreement.  The details are in /net/idl/license.dat.  The
University contact for these things is Russell McDuff
<mcduff@ocean.washington.edu>.  The cost is $25/seat.

=======================================================================

The license server is the undergrad fileserver - tamiel.   The license
server is started by the script:

  /etc/rc.d/init.d/lmgrd.rsi

It puts its logs in:

  /a1/ETC/flexlm/rsi.log

which has grown to gargantuan proportions and should be cleaned out.

=======================================================================

The previous version is still available as a 7 minute demo under
/net/idl_5.2

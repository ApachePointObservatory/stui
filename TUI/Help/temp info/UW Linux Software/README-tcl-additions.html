<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>To use, you must create an environment variable TCLLIBPATH that points to /net/tcllib. If you use tcsh and Chance Reschke's standard ENV setup, then you can add the following to ~/ENV/.cshrc.personal:
</p>
<pre>setenv TCLLIBPATH "/net/tcllib"</pre>

<h2>Tcl/Tk Additions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>snack 2.2.3: a sound library. See the on-line <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/man/snack2.2/tcl-man.html">manual</a> and <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/">home site</a>. The <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/man/snack2.2/python-man.html">Python interface tkSnack</a> was also installed in <a href="README-python-2.3.3.html">/net/python</a>. Installed 2004-01-08. <b>Warnings</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Not all linux boxes seem have sound support. In particular, at the time of this writing, the two in the 3.5m observing room ("may" and "bonus") do not.
		<li>To hear or record sound you must be directly logged into a linux box. There is no way to transmit sound to an X server.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Notes</h2>

<p>Unless noted below, all software was built according to the included instructions and those instructions contained no surprises.

<h3>snack</h3>

<p>The following changes were required:
<ul>
	<li>./configure requird flags: --with-tcl=/usr/lib --with-tk=/usr/lib
	<li>The Makefile had to be hand-edited to specify the destination prefix (specifying --prefix to ./configure did nothing).
	<li>Before testing, set environment variable TCLLIBPATH to include the directory in which the make was done.
</ul>

<p>The build sequence was:</p>
<pre>cd snack2.2.3/unix
./configure --with-tcl=/usr/lib --with-tk=/usr/lib
# edit Makefile to change the following two lines;
# note: specifying --prefix to ./configure does not work:
SNACK_INSTALL_PATH = /net/tcllib    
SNACK_HINSTALL_PATH = /net/tcllib        
make
# test; modify TCLLIBPATH first:
setenv TCLLIBPATH .
make test
# install tcl code
make install
# install python module
cp ../python/tkSnack.py /net/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages
</pre>

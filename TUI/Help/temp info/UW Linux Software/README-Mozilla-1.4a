http://www.mozilla.org/

The Open Source version of the Netscape browser.  Seems pretty solid.
I've installed the Javascript plugin, and that seems solid, too.
Flash plugin installed, too.

Uses the same ~/.mozilla configuration directory as Netscape 6.x, and
you can safely switch back and forth between the two.  I don't know
how well it works to run both at the same time.

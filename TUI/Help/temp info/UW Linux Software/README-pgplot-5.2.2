The PGPLOT Graphics Subroutine Library is a Fortran- or C-callable,
device-independent graphics package for making simple scientific
graphs. It is intended for making graphical images of publication
quality with minimum effort on the part of the user. For most
applications, the program can be device-independent, and the output
can be directed to the appropriate device at run time.

The PGPLOT library consists of two major parts: a device-independent
part and a set of device-dependent ``device handler'' subroutines for
output on various terminals, image displays, dot-matrix printers,
laser printers, and pen plotters. Common file formats supported
include PostScript and GIF.

PGPLOT itself is written mostly in standard Fortran-77, with a few
non-standard, system-dependent subroutines. PGPLOT subroutines can be
called directly from a Fortran-77 or Fortran-90 program. A C binding
library (cpgplot) and header file (cpgplot.h) are provided that allow
PGPLOT to be called from a C or C++ program; the binding library
handles conversion between C and Fortran argument-passing conventions.

PGPLOT has been tested with UNIX (most varieties, including Linux,
SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, and Irix) and OpenVMS operating systems. I
am unable to provide support for DOS, Windows, Windows/NT, or MacOS,
but I do distribute code provided by users for use with these
operating systems.

======================================================================

To Use:

Before running any PGPLOT program, you must ensure that the environment
variable PGPLOT_DIR is correctly defined. This is the name of the directory
in which PGPLOT will look for the files grfont.dat and rgb.txt (unless
environment variables PGPLOT_FONT and PGPLOT_RGB are defined to override
this default behavior), and, if needed, the X-window server program
pgxwin_server:
 
UNIX csh:       setenv PGPLOT_DIR /net/pgplot/
UNIX sh:        PGPLOT_DIR="/net/pgplot/"; export PGPLOT_DIR
 
It is also convenient, but not essential, to define a default PGPLOT device
with environment variable PGPLOT_DEV, e.g.
 
UNIX csh:       setenv PGPLOT_DEV      /xwin

I found I also had to:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /net/pgplot

The Vpfit packages depend on the pgplot libraries

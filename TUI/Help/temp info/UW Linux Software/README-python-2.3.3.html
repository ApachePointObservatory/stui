<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This python is newer than RedHat's and includes support for Tkinter and the additional packages listed below.

<p>To use it, you must specify the whole path /net/python/bin/python or update your PATH to include /net/python/bin (see next). Otherwise you will get RedHat's Python.

<p>If you use tcsh and Chance Reschke's standard ENV setup, then you can update your path by adding the following to ~/ENV/.cshrc.personal:
</p>
<pre>setenv PATH "/net/python/bin/:"$PATH</pre>

<h2>Additonal packages installed</h2>

<p>All packages are installed in the standard location, so you can simply import them without having to define the environment variable PYTHONPATH. That location is /net/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/.</p>

<ul>
<li>Numeric-23.1: efficient matrix manipulation. See the on-line <a href="http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/html2/numpy.html">manual</a> and <a href="http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/">home site</a>. Installed 2004-01-07.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>tkSnack 2.2.3: a sound library based on tk. See <a href="README-tcl-additions.html">Tcl Additions</a> for more information. Installed 2004-01-08.
</ul>

<h2>Installation Notes</h2>

<p>Unless noted below, all software was built according to the included instructions and those instructions contained no surprises. For Python packages, the typical installation is:
</p>
<pre>/net/python/bin/python setup.py install</pre>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>
Python installation used the configure flag --enable-unicode=ucs4 because of a note in the Python README to the effect that RedHat's tcl/tk uses ucs4 instead of the ucs2 that Python expects. Presumably at some point this flag will no longer be needed. The exact sequence was:
</p>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/net/tui --enable-unicode=ucs4
make
make test
make install
</pre>

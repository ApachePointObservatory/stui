Below are theinstructions that you can add to your web pages.  Everything seems to beworking with Windows (at least I can see the log window updating andthings seem connected from my end.).  I will let you know if I findproblems with TUI on Windows.Jack Dembicky===========================================Installation of TUI (V0.90b4) on Windows (XP)(unless noted otherwise use the default settings/directories for allinstallations)1) Download/Install Python 2.3.4 (http://www.python.org/2.3.4) for windows(filename Python-2.3.4.exe)2) Download/Install Mark Hammonds Python Win32 Extensions(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018) Build 202 Besure to get the correct version (2.3) for your install of Python.(filename pywin32-202.win32-py2.3.exe)3) Download/Install ActiveTcl 8.4.7.0(http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/). (filenameActiveTcl8.4.7.0-win32-ix86-108887.exe)4) Download/Install numpy V23.3(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351).Be sure to get the windows .exe file not the Unix one!!! (filenameNumeric-23.1.win32-py2.3.exe)5) Download/Unpack/Install Snack(http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/download.html).  Download the Pythonversion, unzip, and then from the created directory copy tkSnack.py toc:\Python23\Lib and snacklib folder to c:\Python23\tcl\  (filenamesnack227-py.zip)6) Download/Unpack latest source version of TUI (filenameTUI_0.90b4_Source_2004-08-27.zip)7) Open python command prompt window in windows (Start/Programs/Python2.3/python (command line))8) Now lets test the install (this is based on the Unix installinstructions) according to the TUI install documentation(http://tycho.apo.nmsu.edu:81/TUI/Installation.html)Type the following in the Python (command line) window to verify thingsare installed correctly.>>>import Tkinter       # if this and the next step both work then Tkinteris properly installed>>>root = Tkinter.Tk()  # you should see a new empty window>>>import Numeric       # if this works then Numeric is installed>>>import tkSnack       # if this and the next step both work then tkSnackis installed>>>tkSnack.initializeSnack(root)If no errors are displayed in your Python (command line) window theneverything is be working!!!Type Ctrl-Z and then press the enter key to exit the Python (command line)window9) Now Unzip the TUI archive and copy the directory to the location ofyour choice.  I choose c:\ and renamed the created directory as TUI (ie.rename c:\TUI_0.90b4_Source_2004-08-27 as c:\TUI)10) Run the program in the PythonRO directory called runtui.py (ex.C:\TUI\PythonRO\runtui.py).  You should be able to double click it fromwindows to make it run.  This should open up a bunch of TUI windows onyour screen.11) Log into TUI to make sure everything is working12) If all works fine then you can create a desktop shortcut on yourwindows screen. To do this right click and hold the file runtui.py (inc:\TUI\PythonRO) and drag it onto your desktop, release the mouse buttonand select create shortcut here.

<p>TUI may occasionally print error messages. These can be very useful when reporting bugs or debugging your own code. The location of the error messages depends on your platform and how you ran TUI:

<h3>unix</h3>

<p>Error messages are written to stderr, which is displayed on your terminal (unless you redirect it).

<p>If you prefer, you may have TUI write to a log file, as described below for Mac and Windows. To do this, execute runtuiWithLog.py instead of runtui.py. The log will show up in your home directory.

<h3>Mac and Windows</h3>

<p>Error messages are written to a log file called "tuilog.txt" in your standard documents directory. In addition, if TUI finds an existing log file in that directory, it renames it to "oldtuilog.txt" (overwriting any existing old log file). Thus if you want to save a log file, please rename it to something other than "tuilog.txt" or "oldtuilog.txt".

<p>If TUI cannot create the log file for any reason, then it writes messages to standard error, which, depending on your platform, can be found here:
<ul>
	<li>MacOS X: output goes to the console. Run /Applications/Utilities/Console to see the console.
	<li>unix: output goes to the terminal you used to launch TUI (unless you redirect it).
	<li>Windows: I don't know. I suspect you have to run a special program to see the output, but I have no idea what it might be.
</ul>

<h2><a href="../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Tidbits</a>:Standard Output and Standard Error</h2>

<p>TUI prints certain messages to standard output or standard error. This information can be very useful when reporting bugs or debugging your own code. The location of this output depends on your platform:

<ul>
	<li>MacOS X: output goes to the console. Run /Applications/Utilities/Console to see the console.
	<li>unix: output is the terminal you used to launch TUI (unless you redirect it).
	<li>Windows: I don't know. I suspect you have to run a special program to see the output, but I have no idea what it might be.
</ul>

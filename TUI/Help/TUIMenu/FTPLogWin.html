It allows you to view details about transfers and abort transfers.</p><p>Please note that all of your images are saved at APO in the usual image directory. Automatic ftp is an convenient way to retrieve copies to your own computer. but if anything goes wrong, you can always manually retrieve the images yourself. Just don't wait too long or they will be deleted at APO!</p><h3>Log Area</h3><p><a name="LogDisplay"></a>The upper portion of the window shows a one-line summary of each transfer. The left column contains the state of the transfer and the right column the name of the file. You may click on a file name to see details about the transfer in the details area (see below).<p><p>States include:</p><ul><li>Queued: the transfer will start when a free connection is available. (The observatory is on a fairly slow;link, so only one transfer may be initiated at a time.)<li>Connecting: the transfer is starting.<li><i>XX</i> %: the percentage of the file transferred<li>Aborting: the transfer is being aborted (at your request). Note that it can take awhile to clean up the connection, and until this occurs, the next queued transfer.<li>Aborted: the transfer has been aborted (at your request).<li>Failed: the transfer has failed. Click on the file name to see the reason.</ul><h3>Details Area</h3><p>The lower portion of the window shows details about the currently selected transfer (if any). To select a transfer, click on a file name in the log area (upper portion of the window). The details are as follows. You can select the text in any field and click/drag to scroll.</p><ul><li><a name="From"></a>From: the name of the file at the APO end, excluding the server and common directory.<li><a name="To"></a>To: the name of the file at your end, excluding the destination root directory (which is set in the Auto FTP panel of Preferences).<li><a name="State"></a>State: the state of the transfer. This usually matches the state in the log summary, but failed transfer includes an explanation.<li><a name="Abort"></a>Abort button: aborts the transfer. The Abort button is only shown for queued or running transfers. Please use with caution; once you abort a transfer, you cannot resume it. On the other hand, you can always retrieve the image manually.</ul><h3>Notes</h3><p>It takes awhile to abort a connection. One side effect of this is that if you try to quit TUI wile files are being transferred, it may take awhile for TUI to quit.</body></html>

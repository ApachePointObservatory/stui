It is brought up by selecting <b>Connect</b> from the TUI Menu. The entities are as follows:</p><ul>	<li><b>User Name</b>: typically your last name, but any descriptive word is fine. This is the name by which you will be seen by others. The hub will alter it a bit if necessary to avoid duplication.	<li><b>Program Name</b>: the name of your program as assigned to you by APO. Do not improvise! Passwords and permissions are both associated with program numbers.	<li><b>Password</b>: the password associated with the program name.	<p>	<li>Status bar: displays the current status of the connection.	<p>	<li><b>Connect</b> button: initiates the connection, Be sure the program name and password are entered first.	<li><b>Cancel</b> button: cancels the pending connection, if any. It does <b>not</b> close the window. Furthermore, closing the window has no effect on a pending connection or disconnection.</ul></body></html>

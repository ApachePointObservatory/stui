It is brought up by selecting <b>Connect</b> from the TUI Menu. The entities are as follows:</p><ul><li>User Name: typically your last name, but any descriptive word is fine. This is how you will show up to other users (though if there are duplicates, the hub will alter you choice a bit, probably by adding a digit).<li>Program Name: a name assigned by APO with an associated password.<li>Password: the password associated with the program name.<li>Status: displays the current status of the connection.<li>Connect button: initiates the connection, Be sure the program name and password are entered first.<li>Cancel: closes the dialog box without connecting.</ul></body></html>

This may be helpful for executing short scripts, as well as more intensive programming such as writing or debugging new widgets. More information about programming STUI may be found <a href="Programming.html">here</a>.</p><p>The Python window is brought up by selecting <b>Python</b> from the STUI Menu. The entities are as follows:</p><ul><li>The main text area is where you enter Python code.<li>Open...: open a text file (presumably containing Python code) in its own Python window.<li>Save...: save the current text to a file.<li>Clear: clear the text area. (This button may go away if I ever implement cmd-A for select all).<li>Run: run the current text.</ul></body></html>

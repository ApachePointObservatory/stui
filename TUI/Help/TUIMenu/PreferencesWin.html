<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>   <title>STUI:STUI Menu:Preferences Window</title></head><h2><a href="../index.html">STUI</a>:<a href="index.html">STUI Menu</a>:Preferences Window</h2><p>The Preferences window allows you to specify various application preferences (surprise!). It is brought up by selecting <b>Preferences</b> from the STUI Menu.<h2>Preferences</h2><p>The list at the left selects the category; preferences in the selected category are shown in the area to the right. Each preference may be edited by clicking on it. If the value is changed to anything other than the current value then an exclamation mark is shown between the name and the value.<h3>Connection</h3><ul>	<li><a name="Connection:UserName"></a><b>User Name</b>: default value for the "User Name" field of the Connect window. You are free to choose your own name, but spaces and special characters are not allowed.	<li><a name="Connection:Host"></a><b>Host</b>: the IP address of the hub, optionally followed by a space and a port number (which defaults to 9877). This field should be <code>hub35m.apo.nmsu.edu</code> unless you are told otherwise.</ul><h3><a name="Exposures"></a>Exposures</h3><ul>	<li><a name="Exposures:SeqByFile"></a><b>Seq By File</b>: controls whether whether images are numbered in the order taken (unchecked) or are numbered separately for each image name (checked). For example, suppose you take two images named "bias", two named "flat" and one more named "bias". Numbering in order (unchecked) yields: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0003.fits, flat.0004.fits, bias.0005.fits. Numbering by file name (checked) yields: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0001.fits, flat.0002.fits, bias.0003.fits.<p>Note: this setting only applies to images within a particular directory; numbering always starts over for images in a new directory.		<li><a name="Exposures:AutoGet"></a><b>Auto Get</b>: if checked, and if a valid Save To directory has been set, images are automatically downloaded to your computer.	<ul>		<li>Images are saved in a subdirectory that matches the structure at APO, including your program name and the current date.		<li>If a matching file already exists in your destination directory, the automatic download fails, but the image is still saved at APO.		<li>You may view the status of downloads and abort downloads using the <a href="DownloadsWin.html">Downloads window</a> under the STUI menu.	</ul>	<li><a name="Exposures:GetCollab"></a><b>Get Collab</b>: if checked, collaborators' images are retrieved, else only images you take are retrieved. Collaborators are people logged in using the same program name as yourself. (Ignored if Auto Get is disabled.)	<li><a name="Exposures:SaveTo"></a><b>Save To</b>: directory used to save science images and the most recent guide images. Science images are saved in a subdirectory hierarchy that includes your program number and the date of observation (the same hierarchy used at APO in /export/images). Thus you may use the same Save To directory for all of your work, without fear of overwriting images or losing track of which image was taken when or for which program.	<li><a name="Exposures:ViewImage"></a><b>View Image</b>: if checked, images are displayed in ds9 after they are downloaded. Auto Get must be checked and a valid Save To directory selected for View Image to have any effect.    <li><a name="Exposures:UMask"></a><b>UMask</b>: controls permissions for saved images and image directories, <a href="#PrefFile">preferences files</a> and the <a href="../Tidbits/ErrorLog.html">error log</a>. Useful values include:    <ul>        <li>077 for maximum privacy        <li>027 to allow read access to group members, but no access to others        <li>022 to allow read access to everyone (group and other); this is often the default        <li>002 to allow read/write access to group members and read access to others    </ul></ul><h3><a name="Sounds"></a>Sounds</h3><p>Specify sound files for various sound queues. The recommended format is .wav with a sampling rate of 22.05 or 44.1 KHz, as this seems to be compatible with most computers. Other formats that may work include mp3, au, snd, aiff, sd, smp, csl and raw binary.<p>Sound queues can only be played if your computer is capable of playing sounds and the "snack" sound library is installed. Otherwise a substitute beep pattern is played (a pattern you cannot change). Note that X terminals can only beep, and some may not even be able to do that.<h2>Other Controls</h2><p>The controls along the bottom are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Show</b>: allows you to set the edit field for all preferences (in all categories) to the specified state. The states are as follows:	<ul>		<li><b>Current</b>: set edit field to the current value that the program is using		<li><b>Initial</b>: set edit field to the value that was in use when you first opened the Preferences window		<li><b>Default</b>: set edit field to the default value for this preference	</ul>	Note that "Show" only changes the edit fields. It does affect on the preferences used by STUI until you push Apply or Save.<li><b>Apply</b>: applies the current value of all preferences (in all categories). This means STUI starts using the new values and they become "current". However, your changes will be forgotten when you quit STUI unless you also Save.<li><b>Save</b>: applies the current value of all preferences and then writes the preferences out to your preferences file. They will then be remembered for next time you run STUI.</ul><p>Each preference also has a contextual menu which supports at least the following for just that one preference:</p><ul><li><b>Current</b>: set this one edit field to the current value that the program is using<li><b>Initial</b>: set this one edit field to the value that was in use when you first opened the Preferences window<li><b>Default</b>: set this one edit field to the default value for this preference<li><b>Apply</b>: apply this one preference. STUI starts using the value in the edit field and thus it becomes the current value. The value is used but not saved unless press the Save button (see above).</ul><p><b>Warning:</b> if you close the preferences window without applying changes, you are not warned. I hope to fix this eventually.</p><h2><a name="PrefFile"></a>Where are preferences and window geometry stored?</h2><p>The location depends on your operating system. Preferences are stored here:<ul>	<li>unix: .STUIPrefs in your home directory: <code>~/.STUIPrefs</code>.	<li>MacOS X: STUIPrefs in your preferences folder, e.g. <code><i>homedir</i>/Library/Preferences/STUIPrefs</code>.	<li>Windows: STUIPrefs in your application data directory, e.g. <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data\STUIPrefs</code>.</ul><p>Window geometry information is saved in the same location, but in a file named STUIGeom instead of STUIPrefs.<p>Both files are plain text and are easily edited by hand. Errors in a file may give odd results but should not cause any instability in STUI<p><b>Warning:</b> if you are using Python 2.2.x (rather than something newer), then both files must have line endings appropriate to your operating system. (MacOS X users: STUI wants \n, but the prebuilt executable uses Python 2.3 so it's not an issue).</body></html>

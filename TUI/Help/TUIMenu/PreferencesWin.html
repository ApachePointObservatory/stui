<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>   <title>TUI:TUI Menu:Preferences Window</title></head><h2><a href="../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="index.html">TUI Menu</a>:Preferences Window</h2><p>The Preferences window allows you to specify various application preferences (surprise!). It is brought up by selecting <b>Preferences</b> from the TUI Menu.<h2>Preferences</h2><p>The list at the left selects the category; preferences in the selected category are shown in the area to the right. Each preference may be edited by clicking on it. If the value is changed to anything other than the current value then an exclamation mark is shown between the name and the value.<h3>Connection</h3><ul>	<li><a name="Connection:UserName"></a><b>User Name</b>: default value for the "User Name" field of the Connect window. You are free to choose your own name, but spaces and special characters are not allowed.	<li><a name="Connection:Host"></a><b>Host</b>: the IP address of the hub. This should be <code>hub35m.apo.nmsu.edu</code> unless you are told otherwise.</ul><h3><a name="Exposures"></a>Exposures</h3><ul>	<li><a name="Exposures:SeqByFile"></a><b>Seq By File</b>: controls whether image files are numbered by file name or by directory. For example, suppose you take 2 images named "bias", 2 named "flat" and another "bias". Numbering by directory yields images numbered 1-5: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0003.fits, flat.0004.fits, bias.0005.fits. Numbering by file yields bias 1-3 and flat 1-2: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0001.fits, flat.0002.fits, bias.0003.fits.		<li><a name="Exposures:AutoFTP"></a><b>Auto FTP</b>: if checked, and if a valid Save To directory has been set, images are automatically downloaded to your computer (using http protocol; it used to be ftp, which explains the name).	<ul>		<li>Images are saved in a subdirectory that matches the structure at APO, including your program name and the current date.		<li>If a matching file already exists in your destination directory, the automatic download fails, but the image is still saved at APO.		<li>You may view the status of downloads and abort downloads using the <a href="DownloadsWin.html">Downloads window</a> under the TUI menu.	</ul>	<li><a name="Exposures:GetCollab"></a><b>Get Collab</b>: if checked, collaborators' images are retrieved, else only images you take are retrieved. Collaborators are people logged in using the same program name as yourself. (Ignored if Auto FTP is disabled.)	<li><a name="Exposures:SaveTo"></a><b>Save To</b>: directory used to save science images and the most recent guide images. Science images are saved in a subdirectory hierarchy that includes your program number and the date of observation (the same hierarchy used at APO in /export/images). Thus you may to use the same Save To directory for all of your work, without fear of overwriting images or losing track of which image was taken when or for what program.</ul><h3><a name="Sounds"></a>Sounds</h3><p>Specify sound files for various sound queues. The recommended format is .wav with a sampling rate of 22.05 or 44.1 KHz, as this seems to be compatible with most computers. Other formats that may work include mp3, au, snd, aiff, sd, smp, csl and raw binary.<p>Sound queues can only be played if your computer is capable of playing sounds and the "snack" sound library is installed. Otherwise a substitute beep pattern is played (a pattern you cannot change). Note that X terminals can only beep, and some may not even be able to do that.<h2>Other Controls</h2><p>The controls along the bottom are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Show</b>: allows you to set the edit field for all preferences (in all categories) to the specified state. The states are as follows:	<ul>		<li><b>Current</b>: set edit field to the current value that the program is using		<li><b>Initial</b>: set edit field to the value that was in use when you first opened the Preferences window		<li><b>Default</b>: set edit field to the default value for this preference	</ul>	Note that "Show" only changes the edit fields. It does affect on the preferences used by TUI until you push Apply or Save.<li><b>Apply</b>: applies the current value of all preferences (in all categories). This means TUI starts using the new values and they become "current". However, your changes will be forgotten when you quit TUI unless you also Save.<li><b>Save</b>: applies the current value of all preferences and then writes the preferences out to your preferences file. They will then be remembered for next time you run TUI.</ul><p>Each preference also has a contextual menu which supports at least the following for just that one preference:</p><ul><li><b>Current</b>: set this one edit field to the current value that the program is using<li><b>Initial</b>: set this one edit field to the value that was in use when you first opened the Preferences window<li><b>Default</b>: set this one edit field to the default value for this preference<li><b>Apply</b>: apply this one preference. TUI starts using the value in the edit field and thus it becomes the current value. The value is used but not saved unless press the Save button (see above).</ul><p><b>Warning:</b> if you close the preferences window without applying changes, you are not warned. I hope to fix this eventually.</p><h2><a name="PrefFile"></a>Where are preferences and window geometry stored?</h2><p>The location depends on your operating system. Preferences are stored here:<ul>	<li>unix: .TUIPrefs in your home directory: <code>~/.TUIPrefs</code>.	<li>MacOS X: TUIPrefs in your preferences folder, e.g. <code><i>homedir</i>/Library/Preferences/TUIPrefs</code>.	<li>Windows: TUIPrefs in your application data directory, e.g. <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data\TUIPrefs</code>.</ul><p>Window geometry information is saved in the same location, but in a file named TUIGeom instead of TUIPrefs.<p>Both files are plain text and are easily edited by hand. Errors in a file may give odd results but should not cause any instability in TUI<p><b>Warning:</b> if you are using Python 2.2.x (rather than something newer), then both files must have line endings appropriate to your operating system. (MacOS X users: TUI wants \n, but the prebuilt executable uses Python 2.3 so it's not an issue).</body></html>

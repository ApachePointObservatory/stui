<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>   <title>TUI:TUI Menu:Log Window</title></head><body><h2><a href="../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="index.html">TUI Menu</a>:Log Window</h2><p>The log window displays messages from all "actors" (instruments, the TCC, the hub...) and allows to send commands. Controls along the top allow you to filter out unwanted garbage or highlight messages of particular interest.<h3>Filtering</h3><p>Filtering allows you to hide the messages you don't want to see.<p>Press the "Filter:" button to enable filtering. This will show the following filtering controls. The first menu controls severity; all messages with at least this severity are shown. The next control allows you to show selected additional messages.<p>Common tasks:<ul>	<li>To be left alone unless things go wrong, set severity to Warnings and ignore everything else.	<li>To keep an eye on everything, set severity to Normal. That at least filters out the debug messages (which are almost always useless).	<li>To watch particular instrument (or other actor), set severity to Warnings, set the next menu to "+ Actor" and pick an actor from the 3rd menu. This will show all messages from that particular actor, plus warnings and error messages from anywhere.</ul><p>Notes:<ul>	<li>The entry field for "+ Actors" and "+ Commands" filtering accept space-separated <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expressions</a>.	<li>The entry field for "+ Text" filtering accepts one <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>.</ul><h3>Finding</h3><p>To find a particular bit of text, type something into the Find: box and hit &lt;return&gt; to search from the most recent message (or the selection, if any), backwards in time. You can also type ctrl-&lt;return&gt; to search forwards.<p>Notes:<ul>	<li>Searching is not case sensitive.	<li>The search string is a <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>.</ul><h3>Highlighting</h3><p>Highlighting allows you color-code messages of particular interest. You may also play a sound cue when a highlighted message comes in, which is useful for keeping track of rare occurrances (but potentially maddening for frequent hits). To enable highlighting, press the <code>Highlight:</code> button. This shows the various highlight controls, which I hope are self-explanatory.<p><b>Warning: you can only highlight messages you can see!</b> Be sure you aren't filtering out messages you want to hightlight!<p>Notes:<ul>	<li>The entry field for "Actors" and "Commands" highlighting accept space-separated <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expressions</a>.	<li>The entry field for "Text" highlighting accepts one <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>.</ul><h3>Sending Commands</h3><p>To send commands to an actor, type into the bottom field of the window. Normally you type the actor name (all lowercase), a space, and the command (which can be anything the actor understands), followed by &lt;return&gt; to send the command. For example "tcc show time&lt;return&gt;" will return the time from the TCC.<p>If you plan to send many messages to a particular actor, you may select the actor from the menu next to the command entry field. TUI will then automatically fill in that actor's name for you (though you can change it). Remember that you can also highlight replies from a particular actor or even filter out all other messages. This can be very handy for an intensive session with one instrument.<p>The command entry area also has command history. Use the up arrow to recall earlier commands; edit as desired and reissue with &lt;return&gt;. (If you issue the same command several times in a row, only the first is stored in the command history.)<h3><a name="RegularExpressions">Regular Expressions</a></h3><p>All Filter, Find and Highlight text entry boxes accept regular expressions (just one for Text; a set of space-separated regular expressions for Actors and Commands). These are <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/396">tcl regular expression</a>, which are very much like python or perl regular expressions.</body></html>

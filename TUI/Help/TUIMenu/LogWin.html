It has a <a href="#Toolbar">tool bar</a> to support filtering (hiding and showing) categories of data and for searching through the log. You can also send commands to the hub via the <a href="#CommandEntry">command entry field</a> at the bottom.</p><h3><a name="Toolbar"></a>Tool Bar</h3><p>The tool bar along the top has controls to filter and search the data:</p><ul>	<li><a name="Commands"></a>The <b>Commands</b> menu allows you specify which commands sent by TUI are displayed:	<ul>		<li><b>All</b> displays all commands, both those specified by the user and also automatically generated refresh commands.		<li><b>User</b> displays just commands triggered by the user.		<li><b>None</b> hides all commands	</ul>	<li><a name="Replies"></a>The <b>Replies</b> menu allows you specify which replies are displayed:	<ul>		<li><b>All</b> displays all replies		<li><b>Warning</b> displays warnings and errors		<li><b>Error</b> displays only errors		<li><b>None</b> hides all replies	</ul>	<li><a name="Find"></a><b>Find:</b> enter text in the field and press &lt;return&gt; or the Find: button to search for it.	<ul>		<li>The text is interpreted as a regular expression (using standard Perl syntax). When searching for literal punctuation, precede it with backslash ("\").		<li>The search always goes from more recent to older entries.		<li>If there is a selection in the log window, the search begins from there. If there is no selection, the search begins at the end of the log. Hence to start a new search, make sure there is no selection in the log window (i.e. click anywhere within it to remove the current selection). Note that this is a selection, <b>not</b> the insertion cursor; the position of the insertion cursor is ignored.		<li>The search does not wrap around; it stops with the oldest entry.		<li>Case is ignored ("objpos" will find "ObjPos").	</ul></ul><h3>Main log window</h3><p><a name="LogDisplay"></a>The main log window works as follows:</p><ul><li>If you scroll the log window to the very bottom, it will auto-scroll as new data comes in. At any other scroll position the log will not scroll (until the data being displayed is so old that it is flushed).<li>You can select and copy text from the log window, but you cannot modify it (at least I hope not; if you find a way to do so without using Python, please submit a bug report).<li>If you have text selected and you show more log entries, the log will attempt to continue showing the selected entries. Thus you can display just warnings, for instance, find one of interest, select some text in it, and show all entries to see what was going on around that time.</ul><h3>Command Entry Field</h3><p><a name="CommandEntry"></a>The command input field at the bottom sends commands to the hub. To issue a command, type it in the one-line entry field at the bottom and hit &lt;return&gt; (from anywhere within the command). The command format is <code>actor command</code>, where:</p><ul><li>Actor is the instrument or device that should execute the command, e.g. "dis" or "tcc". Actors are always lowercase.<li>Command is any command that the actor understands.</ul><p>For example: <code>tcc show time</code> and <code>dis status</code> are valid commands.</p>Notes:<ul><li>Use the up arrow to recall earlier commands; edit as desired and reissue with &lt;return&gt;. (If you issue the same command several times in a row, only the first is stored in the command history.)<li>TUI automatically chooses a unique command ID number and includes it (at the start of the command) when it sends the command to the hub. Thus you should <b>not</b> specify a command ID number when you type a command.</ul></body></html>

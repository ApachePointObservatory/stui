The 3.5m guiders are very powerful, but they can't make all the decisions by themselves, so you'll get better results if you know what you're doing.<h2>Contents</h2><ul>	<li><a href="#GeneralTips">General Tips</a>	<li><a href="#SlitviewerTips">Slitviewer Tips</a>	<li><a href="#NA2GuiderTips">NA2 Guider Tips</a>	<li><a href="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></ul><h2><a name="GeneralTips">General Tips</a></h2><ul><li>All of the guiders can guide on any object which is symmetric  (galaxies with strong cores are fine), not too faint, and  non-saturated. Optical double stars, late-type, and bipolar PNs  may pose a problem for guiding, as will objects where you desire to  observe a position away from the bright center (e.g., SNs near  bright galaxies). Any object the guide softare thinks is usable  will be circled in green. If your favored guide object is not  circled, it may be too faint, too bright, or too lumpy.<li>Always make sure you're looking at a current image before you  ctrl-click (for the slitviewers) or start guiding (any slitviewer  or guider).<li>Don't be afraid to use longer exposure times to get better signal  from your star. The best exposure times are 5-30 seconds, but up  to 120 seconds is usable if you can be patient. Longer exposure  times can also help if you're having data transfer problems.  Exposures shorter than about 3s are a waste of image-transfer  bandwidth and may cause you to overguide on seeing fluctuations.<li>The guider will stop automatically if you slew, but as of summer  2006 there is an intermittent bug associated with this which may  crash the guider. Pressing the Stop Guiding button before you slew  will ensure a more graceful stop.</ul><h2><a name="SlitviewerTips">Slitviewer Tips</a></h2><h3>Check The Mask and Boresight</h3><p>At the beginning of your observing time, check the mask and boresight:	<ul>	<li><b>Mask</b> Make sure the green mask is correctly centered on the slit. If it isn't, ask the observing specialist to obtain a new mask image. This only takes 5-10 minutes and will improve guiding considerably, especially for fainter targets.		<li><b>Boresight</b> Make sure the little blue cross marking the Boresight (desired position) is centered on the slit. If it isn't, zoom in on the slit and move your cursor to the center of the slit, then read the cursor position. Ask the observing specialist to set the imcenter to the Y position you read, or do it yourself in the Log window with the command<br>	<code>tcc set imcenter=(240.0, <i>ypos</i>)</code><br>	where <i>ypos</i> is the position you determined above. (Please only change the X position only for special circumstances). If the blue cross is NOT in the right place, Boresight guiding ctrl-click to center will be inaccurate.</ul><h3>Pick The Right Mode</h3><ul>	<li><b>Boresight</b> is your best bet if your target is symmetrical and bright enough to show wings on both sides of the slit:	<ul>		<li>DIS: brighter than approximately magnitude 16 in good seeing/transparency conditions (brighter for poor conditions).		<li>Echelle: any star bright enough for the echelle spectrograph should be	bright enough for the echelle slitviewer.	</ul>		<p>Boresight guiding is convenient because your target doesn't have to be perfectly centered before you press the Guide button; the guider will pull it in as long as it's within a few arcseconds of the blue cross. You can control-click your target onto the boresight, verify its position and brightness on the new image and turn on guiding.	<p>If your target is to faint and you have a suitable star in the slitviewer field then consider Field Star guiding. 		<li><b>Field Star</b> is good if your object is too faint or asymmetrical for Boresight guiding, or if you need the slit to be off-center. The default guide star will always be the brightest non-saturated star in the field, but because of distortions in the slitviewer's re-imaging optics, you will usually get better results by choosing a star near the center of the field, even if it's fainter. Use ObjXY offsets in the Offset window to get your target positioned as perfectly as you can under the slit before you press the Guide button.		<p>Before you start Field Star guiding, center your object on the boresight as well as you can. You can try control-clicking your object for initial centering. If the result is not good enough, then apply Guide XY offsets using the Nudger (in the TCC window) to improve it.  	<p><b>Warning:</b> avoid Guide XY offsets while autoguiding; they will just fight the autoguider! If you want to manually improve the centering while autoguiding is active, use Object XY offsets, instead.		<li><b>Manual</b> guiding is used if your target is too faint or irregular and there is nothing else in the field to guide on (this is rare with the DIS slitviewer). You may also use Manual guiding to keep watching for a hole in clouds.  	<p>For easiest Manual guiding, open the Nudger window from the TCC menu. You can use either Guide XY offsets (these move the <b>slit</b>, not the star) or Boresight offsets if you are more accustomed to them (these move the <b>star</b>, not the slit). Set the MaxOff to 1 if seeing is fairly good, 2 if seeing is bad or conditions are windy. The box with the crosshairs is a picture of the n arcseconds around the slit, where n is MaxOff. Click in the box to show the direction and distance you want the slit or star to move, depending on what kind of offset you're using.</ul><h2><a name="NA2GuiderTips">NA2 Guider Tips</a></h2><ul>	<li>Use Field Star guiding almost always. The default star will be the	brightest non-saturated star in the field. Feel free to pick	another green-circled star closer to the center of the field,	especially if you will be guiding during a dither script.		<li>Use Manual guiding when your field is lost in clouds and you want	to keep the guider taking images so you can watch for a hole. The	guider will switch over automatically to Manual guiding is it loses	the star for many exposures.		<li>Don't try to make offsets yourself to adjust the position of a star	on the NA2 guider. It won't move in the direction you expect it	to. The only exception to this is the very rare case where the	guider is the science instrument, and it says "GUIDER" at the top	of the Focal Plane window.		<li>If there are no objects bright enough in the field or your desired	guide star is just a little too faint, ask the observing specialist	to change to the Clear guider filter (as opposed to the default R	filter). Guider exposure times up to 30 or even 60s are still good	as long as 1) your science exposure is at least 5 times as long,	and 2) you are using Object rotation and normal sidereal tracking	rates. 		<li>If your desired guide star is too bright and saturates in 3s or	less, ask the observing specialist to change to the R+ND2 guider	filter.</ul><h2><a name="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2><p>Written by Russet McMillan (with some adaptation by Russell Owen).</body></html>

<h2><a href="../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Guiding</a>:GCam</h2>

<p>The GCam window controls the NA2 off-axis guider. Most of the controls are <a href="index.html">standard guiding controls</a>. A few gcam-specific controls appear in a box just above the status bar; those controls are described here.

<ul>
	<li><b>Focus</b> the current focus is shown to the left. You may set a new focus in the field to the right.
	<li><b>Filter</b> the current filter is shown to the left. You may select a new filter using the pop-up menu to the right.
	<p>
	<li><b>Apply</b> apply the requested focus and/or filter change.
	<li><b>Current</b> restore the user-set focus and filter to the current settings.
</ul>

<p>Note: only the Apply button sends any commands to gcam. The other controls in this box specify what commands Apply should send.

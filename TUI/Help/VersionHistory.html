<h2><a href="index.html">STUI</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: works with MacOS X 10.6, 10.5 and 10.4 and is a universal binary. MacOS X 10.3.9 is no longer supported, though it may work (one known problems is that you cannot save window positions; this is due to a bug in Tcl/Tk that will never be fixed).
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>Windows: no Windows releases are planned.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4b1 2009-10-29</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added basic guider display. It is not well tested but can display (at this point I'm not even sure automatic image download works.)
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3.1 2009-10-09</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a rudimentary BOSS status display.
    <li>New icon from a photo of the 2.5m telescope by Dan Long.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Stopped playing the Critical Alert sound cue for warning alerts.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3 2009-09-16</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added preliminary guider controls (Inst&gt;Guide). Limitations include:
    <ul>
        <li>No way to enable or disable specific guide probes.
        <li>Image download and display is untested (because the guider actor is not yet outputting the files keyword).
        <li>Image plate view is disabled because the the necessary metadata has not yet specified or supplied.
    </ul>
    <li>Switched to new sound cues by Elena and Dmitry for critical and serious alerts. Note that warning alerts are still silent by default (by design).
    <li>Improved the html help documentation, including removing outdated references to the 3.5m.
    <li>Changed name from TUISDSS to STUI.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Restored the missing Axis Halt sound preference.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2.1 2009-09-02</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added the potential for separate sound cues for critical, serious and warning alerts. However, at present the defaults are:
    <ul>
        <li>No sound for warning alerts. Observers should comment on whether this is a good choice.
        <li>SeriousAlert.wav is used for both serious and critical sound cues. This will be changed when I have time to work on sound cues or am given a good pair of cues for serious and critical alerts.
    </ul>
    <li>Added a new color for critical alerts (defaults to orange).
    <li>Added help pages for the Alerts, Interlocks and MCP windows.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.19.
    <li>Older versions of STUI will not work with RO 2.2.19. (This is due to a glitch in the log window that I have fixed in STUI 0.2.1.)
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2 2009-08-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preference to disable sound cues.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.18. This allows the Alerts window to not auto-scroll and allows users to control-click on X11 (a gesture used by the Interlocks display).
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest opscore. This allows parsing Int and Bits keyword values expressed as hex.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest actor dictionaries. This allows it to find the mcp keyword ffsCommandedOpen (which was formerly listed as ffsCommandedOn).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.1 2009-08-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Modified to adapt to a change in the alerts keyword from the alerts actor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed explicit setting of matplotlib "numerix" parameter because it is obsolete in the current release (0.99.0); users will have to make sure their matplotlib uses numpy and not some older, obsolete numeric package.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Added sound cue for serious alerts to the svn repository.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from STUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

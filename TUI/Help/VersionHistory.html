<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/873">873</a> Requested tweaks to the SOP GUI:
    <ul>
        <li>Reordered the commands.

</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:

</ul>

<h3>Version 0.5.3 2010-05-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/794">794</a> Add a 10 um selection to the stui Secondary Focus gui.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>

    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/800">800</a> Windows are now displayed within the visible screen area, even if the saved positions is not (as can easily happen if you sometimes connect a laptop to an external monitor). The code assumes your visible screen is a rectangle, so it can be fooled by strange screen arrangements. (This fix is actually in RO 2.3.5, not in STUI).
    <li>Corrected the display of some MCP axis controller status bits:
    <ul>
        <li>Corrected "Pos. error too large to correct" from bit 17 to 24 and also changed it from a warning to an error so that it will display in red instead of blue.
        <li>Added error "Clock not set" bit 18 (formerly this bit was mislabeled as a windscreen touch).
        <li>Corrected warning "Windscreen touch" bits from 18 &amp; 19 to 29 &amp; 30.

</ul>

<h3>Version 0.5.2 2010-03-19</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Overhauled the status window's display of instrument and cartridge information.
    <li>The About TUI window now shows the paths to special files such as preferences and TUIAdditions directories.
    <li>On unix, the shared TUIAdditions directory is now up one level (to the parent of the parent of the directory named TUI), so that it is independent of the TUI source tree and is shared by all versions of TUI.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Updated the actor dictionaries
    <li>TUI.TUIPaths: added functions getGeomFile and getPrefsFile and added ifExists argument to getAddPaths.
</ul>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The log window is now visible by default.

</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added TUI.Models.getModel(actor). This makes all existing models available and is this is the recommended way to get a model. The old technique will result in a deprecation warning for now, and will eventually stop working altogether.
</ul>
    
<h3>Version 0.5.0 2010-03-11</h3>

<p>Warning for unix users:
<ul>
    <li>Requires RO Package version 2.3.4 and opscore trunk rev 107768 (the latter fixes some bugs in the script system).
</ul>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Status window now includes information about the currently mounted plug-plate cartridge.
    <li>The Users window now shows each client, version and system info.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/613">613</a> STUI guider plate view background levels are wrong.
    <li>Save As is broken in The Run_Commands script.
    <li>Command replies could be shown in the wrong color in status bars (fix adapted from TUI).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4 2010-02-19</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a Guider window.
    <li>Added a guider Focus Plot window.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/392">392</a> Changed log timestamps and time in the Status window from UTC to TAI.
    <li>Added a "Down Instrument" button to the Alerts window.
    <li>Improved the reliability of sound cues. Warning for unix users: this was done by switching from the tkSnack to pygame sound library. This will require you to install pygame (and its dependencies) and a new version of RO. See the unix installation instructions for more information.
    <li>Renamed STUI's <a href="Tidbits/SpecialFiles.html">Special Files</a> as follows. This allow one to run TUI and STUI on the same computer without collisions. You must rename your files to restore your saved settings and additions.
    <ul>
        <li>TUIPrefs to STUIPrefs
        <li>TUIGeom to STUIGeom
        <li>TUIAdditions to STUIAdditions.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/584">584</a> STUI Run_Commands script does not work. In fact the entire scripting system was broken due to relying on the dispatcher, keyword variables and command variables from RO instead of opscore. Fixed by adding ScriptRunner to opscore.actor and ScriptWdg to TUI.Base.Wdg.
    <li>Much sample code did not work because it was not compatible with Twisted.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3.1 2009-10-09</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a rudimentary BOSS status display.
    <li>New icon from a photo of the 2.5m telescope by Dan Long.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Stopped playing the Critical Alert sound cue for warning alerts.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3 2009-09-16</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added preliminary guider controls (Inst&gt;Guide). Limitations include:
    <ul>
        <li>No way to enable or disable specific guide probes.
        <li>Image download and display is untested (because the guider actor is not yet outputting the files keyword).
        <li>Image plate view is disabled because the the necessary metadata has not yet specified or supplied.
    </ul>
    <li>Switched to new sound cues by Elena and Dmitry for critical and serious alerts. Note that warning alerts are still silent by default (by design).
    <li>Improved the html help documentation, including removing outdated references to the 3.5m.
    <li>Changed name from TUISDSS to STUI.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Restored the missing Axis Halt sound preference.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2.1 2009-09-02</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added the potential for separate sound cues for critical, serious and warning alerts. However, at present the defaults are:
    <ul>
        <li>No sound for warning alerts. Observers should comment on whether this is a good choice.
        <li>SeriousAlert.wav is used for both serious and critical sound cues. This will be changed when I have time to work on sound cues or am given a good pair of cues for serious and critical alerts.
    </ul>
    <li>Added a new color for critical alerts (defaults to orange).
    <li>Added help pages for the Alerts, Interlocks and MCP windows.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.19.
    <li>Older versions of STUI will not work with RO 2.2.19. (This is due to a glitch in the log window that I have fixed in STUI 0.2.1.)
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2 2009-08-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preference to disable sound cues.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.18. This allows the Alerts window to not auto-scroll and allows users to control-click on X11 (a gesture used by the Interlocks display).
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest opscore. This allows parsing Int and Bits keyword values expressed as hex.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest actor dictionaries. This allows it to find the mcp keyword ffsCommandedOpen (which was formerly listed as ffsCommandedOn).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.1 2009-08-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Modified to adapt to a change in the alerts keyword from the alerts actor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed explicit setting of matplotlib "numerix" parameter because it is obsolete in the current release (0.99.0); users will have to make sure their matplotlib uses numpy and not some older, obsolete numeric package.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Added sound cue for serious alerts to the svn repository.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from STUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

<h2><a href="index.html">TUISDSS</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: works with MacOS X 10.5 and 10.4 and is a universal binary. MacOS X 10.3.9 is no longer supported, though it may work (one known problems is that you cannot save window positions; this is due to a bug in Tcl/Tk that will never be fixed).
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>Windows: works with Windows Vista, XP and 2000.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2 2009-08-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preference to disable sound cues.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest opscore. This allows it to parse current mcp data.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest actor dictionaries.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to RO 2.2.17. This allows control-click on X11.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.1 2009-08-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Modified to adapt to a change in the alerts keyword from the alerts actor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed explicit setting of matplotlib "numerix" parameter because it is obsolete in the current release (0.99.0); users will have to make sure their matplotlib uses numpy and not some older, obsolete numeric package.
</ul>

    <li>Added sound cue for serious alerts to the svn repository.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from TUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

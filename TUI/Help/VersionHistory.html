<h2><a href="index.html">TUISDSS</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: works with MacOS X 10.5 and 10.4 and is a universal binary. MacOS X 10.3.9 is no longer supported, though it may work (one known problems is that you cannot save window positions; this is due to a bug in Tcl/Tk that will never be fixed).
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>Windows: works with Windows Vista, XP and 2000.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from TUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

<h2><a href="index.html">STUI</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: the Mac binary works with MacOS 10.6 - 10.10, though on 10.9 and 10.10 you should disable app nap (select Get Info on STUI and check "Disable App Nap"). The Mac version is not signed, so MacOS may complain when you try to launch it for the first time. If that happens simply right-click on the application and select "Open...".
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>No Windows releases are planned.
</ul>

<h3>Documentation update 2015-01-13</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added a software license (BSD-3 in doc/license.txt) and changed readMe.txt to ReadMe.md.
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+newtcc_b3+ 2015-01-08</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Axis state words are shown at connect time (fixed in the tcc keyword dictionary).
    <li>Eliminated some cosmetic glitches caused by NaNs in PVT keywords (fixed in RO 3.6.4)
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+newtcc_b3 2015-01-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added help window for Mirror Status.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Mac version reverted tcl/tk to release 8.5.17 in hopes it will solve failure to display new guider images.
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+newtcc_b2 2015-01-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Fixed the SOP windowÂ (I thought the newtcc version of SOP was based on the 2168_2084 prerelease, but it is actually based on the released SOP).
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+newtcc_b1+ 2015-01-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Updated the mirror status widget for the new tcc.
    <li>Mac version: updated the tcc keyword dictionary to handle 6 axis mirrors (e.g. the primary).
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+newtcc+sop_2168_2084 2014-12-23</h3>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Same as 1.5.2+sop_2168_2084 except the Mac version includes the tcc keyword dictionary for the new tcc. This dictionary is supposed to be backwards compatible with the old tcc, but that has not been well tested.
</ul>

<h3>1.5.2+sop_2168_2084 2014-12-17</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Implemented SOP ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2084">2084</a> APOGEE&amp;MaNGA co-observing handling of APOGEE dither mechanism.
    <li>Implemented SOP ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2168">2168</a> Change default APOGEE exposure time for co-observations.
</ul>


<h3>1.5.2 2014-11-21</h3>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The Mac version includes an updated hartmann keyword dictionary.
</ul>

<h3>1.5.1 2014-11-18</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2173">2173</a> in the script "Observations: Telescope Controls" replaced tcc commands with sop commands and added command "guider loadCartridge" instead of previous outdated goto6 button.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>MacOS:
    <ul>
        <li>A duplicate Preferences menu item was shown and only one worked, and that one did not support cmd-comma.
        <li>A duplicate STUI Help menu item was shown and only one worked.
    </ul>
    <li>The test data for SOP needed a bit of updating.
</ul>

<h3>1.5.0 2014-10-27</h3>

<p>Warnings:
<ul>
    <li>If running from source you must update opscore, actorkeys and RO.
    <li>Older versions of STUI will show an error message when sop outputs a certain keyword; you may ignore that error.
</ul> 

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1937">1937</a>: show MaNGA dither information in the guider window.
    <li>Status window: relabelled MJD to SJD to reduce ambiguity.
    <li>Script improvements from Elena:
    <ul>
        <li>Replaced sos actor with hartmann actor in "Test Actors", "Get Versions", and "Log Function" scripts.
        <li>Added "Engineering: Loop Commands" script.
        <li>Added manga dither to Log Function.
    </ul>
    <li>SOP window:
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2061">2061</a>: SOP should show current mode, as reported by the guider survey keyword.
        <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2101">2101</a>: SOP should show new sop survey keyword, if different than the guider survey keyword (e.g. due to a bypass).
        <li>Added support for new doApogeeMangaDither and doApogeeMangaSequence commands.
        <li>Added an extra status bar to display text from sop.
        <li>"Aborted" is shown in blue, instead of red.
        <li>Enhanced plate type display in SOP to show a pink ? if unknown. (Also fixed a minor bug that caused a traceback in the error log file if the value was None).
        <li>Shrunk field widths, where practical, and shaved a line here and there.
    </ul>
    <li>Script 'Goto 6 MCP' changed to 'Goto 5 MCP'
    <li>Updated the installation instructions.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Slew window: corrected displayed of units of distance from parsec to au.
    <li>Status was not shown in pink after disconnecting.
    <li>SOP window:
    <ul>
        <li>removed a debugger breakpoint.
        <li>Goto Field command: guider flat time is now properly associated with both the calibs and guider stages.
        <li>doBossCalibs parameters were not shown.
        <li>The sop actor had changed in ways that SOP didn't know about, including adding new kind of stage that the SOP window did not support. SOP continued to work, but it resulted in nasty error messages in the log.
        <li>SOP Goto Field had the guide parameters assigned to the wrong stage. The fix is not perfect, because guider flat time is actually used by two different stages, but nobody seems to care and fixing it would require a major overhaul of the the SOP widget code.
        <li>Message window: typing certain characters in the upper window would cause a traceback in the log. Also navigation keys now work correctly in the upper pane.
        <li>SOP: fixed two cosmetic errors in SOP modules exposed by pyflakes (as well as some bugs in StageInfo.py; a file that STUI is not presently using).
    </ul>
    <li>Guider window used httpGet.getErrMsg() instead of .errMsg (thanks to John Parejko for the fix).
    <li>Closing&gt;Goto 6 MCP script was broken.
    <li>APOGEE&gt;Morning Cals script did not reliably halt if a command failed.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Mac build includes a release candidate of Tcl/Tk 8.5.17; barring unexpected bugs, this should be a significant improvement over the ancient version I had to use previously, especially for users on MacOS 10.9 (I have no idea how Tcl/Tk works on 10.10).
    <li>The Mac version runs in 64 bit mode again (permissible due to the newer version of Tcl/Tk).
    <li>Source releases now include RO.
    <li>STUI is now in git: git@github.com:r-owen/stui.git
    <li>SOP window:
    <ul>
        <li>updated bypass widget to use new sop keyword "bypassedNames".
        <li>allow parameters to be associated with more than one stage.
        <li>simplified command description format and made it fit the new sop better (if a command has only fake stages then it can be expressed that way).
        <li>updated to sop keyword dictionary rev 157205.        
    </ul>
    <li>Updated to current actorkeys and opscore.
    <li>Updated release script for git.
</ul>

<h3>1.4.0 2014-05-20</h3>

<p>Warning: as of the release date, this version will not work with the released version of SOP. It requires the MaNGA branch of SOP (and of actorkeys, if running from source).

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Log files are now saved to a subdirectory.
    <li>Implemented enhancement request <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1698">1698</a>: moving "Do (BOSS) Calibs" in boss SOP GUI. I moved all calibration-like stages after Goto Gang Change and Goto Instrument Change.
    <li>Implemented enhancement request <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2020">2020</a>: increase STUI scrollback buffer size. I increased the total remembered log entries from 40,000 to 100,000 and the log window scrollback from 20,000 to 100,000. If this becomes a memory issue I may have to make it user-settable, but I'm very reluctant to add another preference or try to guess what the setting should be based on available memory.
    <li>Improved compatibility with MacOS 10.9: the application now runs in 32-bit mode, though you should still manually disable app nap.
    <li>Overhauled the introduction document and expanded the instructions for running the MacOS version there an in this version history.
    <li>Added APOGEE dither_clearing_script.  
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1902">1902</a>: Reopen script windows at startup.
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1974">1974</a>: SOP command changes for MaNGA
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1996">1996</a>: new SOP command apogeeDomeFlat
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1745">1745</a>: prevent flat field lamp turning on during exposure by adding an "Enable Commands?" button to the MCP window.
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1802">1802</a>: STUI should allow more than 5 log windows.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Script Pause/Resume lost the value returned by the last wait (fixed in opscore ScriptRunner).
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/2018">2018</a>: STUI v1.3.1b3 does not show guider images.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1884">1884</a>: Apogee evening cals failed from podium laptop
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1915">1915</a>: STUI SOP defaults to Seq Count=3 for APOGEE carts.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Updated actorkeys to revision 155764 of branches/mangadb.
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1972">1972</a>: SOP uses guiderTime to specify guider exposure time during gotoField
    <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1836">1836</a>: use "from PIL import Image" instead of "import Image", for compatibility with Pillow (a modern replacement for PIL). Warning: you must update your copy of the RO package to at least 3.2.2 for Pillow compatibility.
    <li>Mac version includes matplotlib 1.3.1.
</ul>

<h3>1.3 2013-09-05</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>SOP window: implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1735">1735</a>: swap Stop and Modify buttons.
    <li>Scripts menu: Run_Commands now supports "tui wait <i>nSec</i>", thanks to Elena Malanushenko.
    <li>Scripts:
    <ul>
        <li>Moved the following scripts from the Elena's scripts package into STUI, with updated names (many of these scripts were also updated):
        <ul>
            <li>APOGEE:apogeeTimer -> APOGEE:Timer
            <li>APOGEE:cartchange -> APOGEE:Cart Change
            <li>APOGEE:eveningcals -> APOGEE:Evening Cals
            <li>BOSS:bossTimer -> BOSS:Timer
            <li>Observations:dustCounter -> Observations:Dust Counter
            <li>Observations:goto6mcp -> Observations:Goto 6 MCP
            <li>Observations:spiralPattern -> Observations:Spiral Pattern
            <li>Startup:plugging -> Startup:Plugging
            <li>Startup:threeReadDark -> Startup:Short Dark
        </ul>
        <li>Added script Engineering:Test BOSS Collimator which exercises the collimator motors and reports motion error statistics.
        <li>Moved the Goto 6 MCP script from Observations to Closing.
    </ul>
    <li>Guider window:
    <ul>
        <li>Added guide probe annotation to non-plate-view guide images.
        <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1757">1757</a>: add a Stack option.
        <li>Implemented ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1704">1704</a>: each guide probe's number is followed by + or - if the probe is an above-focus or below-focus probe.
        <li>Put exposure time and related controls all on the same line, to save space.
    </ul>
    <li>Documentation:
    <ul>
        <li>Updated the overview of <a href="http://sdss3.apo.nmsu.edu/opssoft/stui/Scripts/BuiltInScripts/index.html">built in scripts</a> in STUI's <a href="http://sdss3.apo.nmsu.edu/opssoft/stui/index.html">help</a>.
        <li>Updated the installation instructions.
    </ul>
    <li>Mac version: upgraded to the latest actorkeys and plc v30_2.
    <li>The computer platform is now listed in the error log (or stdout on unix).
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in opscore that caused refresh of keyvars to fail if the refreshCmdDict is modified at the wrong time. This was triggered by the Test Actors script.
    <li>The tutorial script "5 Actor Versions" had a bug due to bit rot: TCC version is returned in the version keyword (when the script was written it was returned in a text keyword).
    <li>The Mac version can now be run in 32-bit mode (formerly the included PIL was incompatible, which resulted in failure to show guide images).
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1558">1558</a>: there are two different build instructions for STUI.app.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1807">1807</a>: opscore.actor.ScriptRunner mishandles a failed wait.
    <li>Mac build only: the included matplotlib would not work on MacOS X 10.6 and (probably) 10.7 due to <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/2151">matplotlib issue 2151</a>.
    <li>GuideWdg: variables "havePlateInfo" and "plateInfo" were not always defined before being used.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1765">1765</a>: error when attempting to enable or disable a fiber.
    <li>Guider window: worked around a TkAqua bug that could cause the name of the last probe in a row to be hidden.
    <li>Use STUI instead of TUI in startup messages in the log window and error log file.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added apogeeGangLabelHelp to MCP model (since I could not figure out a nice way to access labelHelp
    given an instance of the apogeeGang Key). An alternative is to make a synthetic keyword such as
    apogeeGangText and hide the ugliness in the model, but then there is no way to know the max length in advance.
    <li>Various code was updated to handle the modified apogeeGang keyword.
    <li>AssembleImage moved from stui to opscore/utilities at John Parejko's request.
    <li>Eliminated the synthesized keyword guider.fullGProbeBits and modified STUI code to use gprobeBits directly, now that ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/433">433</a> is fixed.
    <li>The Mac build now uses matplotlib 1.3.0
</ul>

<h3>1.2 2012-12-19</h3>

<p>Requirements changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Mac version now requires MacOS X 10.6 or later
    <li>Users running from source must use RO package 3.1.0 or later
</ul>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Updated the interlocks displays based on plc v29_1.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1688">1688</a> SOP safeguards:
    <ul>
        <li>The "X" buttons now only re-enable your local SOP buttons (so you can send another SOP command); it never sends anything to SOP. Thus it is always safe to press "X".
        <li>The "Stop" buttons always bring up a dialog box asking for confirmation.
    </ul>
    <li>The guider window now shows 0=BOSS, 1=APOGEE for refraction balance and it no longer tries to use guider keyword refractionWavelengths, since that keyword is obsolete.
    <li>All checkbuttons are now displayed with a checkbox, because this is required on MacOS X when using Tcl/Tk 8.5.
    <li>Removed the useless and outdated Permissions window.
    <li>Removed state of MARVELS gang connector from MCP window.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1714">1714</a> STUI shows wrong time if computer not on UTC. TUI now shows the correct time even if the user's clock is keeping TAI or has drifted. However, displayed time may be off by a second or two unless the computer's clock is keeping accurate UTC or TAI.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Mac version uses Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.5, which has many internal changes compared to 8.4.
    <li>Modified to use apo/plc instead of apo/interlocks.
    <li>Updated to use current actorkeys.
    <li>Now has the ability to use Twisted framework for communications, though this is off by default since it is slower. Change a flag in Main.py to use Twisted.
    <li>Removed use of update_idletasks to eliminate a source of subtle bugs.
    <li>Most timers now use RO.TkUtil.Timer; this simplifies the code a bit and eliminates the need for some Tk widgets.
    <li>Removed use of deprecated dict method has_key.
</ul>

<h3>1.1.2b5 2012-06-19</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added Elena's Observations/Log Support script. 
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Improved compatibility with Tcl/Tk 8.5 on Mac OS X by eliminating a cause of duplicate application menus.
    <li>The Mac application should play sounds more reliably. (I removed an unused smpeg library that appeared to be causing problems).
</ul>

<h3>1.1.2b4 2012-06-04</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Increased the time range from 700 seconds to 1800 seconds to match most of the others; if this is a problem, please let Russell know.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Plays guider sound cues. This corrects a long standing oversight: sound cues were present, but never played. I also improved the sound cues.
    <li>Added missing sound cue for Elena's fiducials script (I had copied the script, but not the sound cue) and made the sound a bit louder.
    <li>Fixed clear buttons on strip chart widgets.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Reduce CPU usage by making hidden strip charts do much less work. If STUI is bogging down your machine close the strip charts that you don't need.
</ul>

<h3>1.1.2b3 2012-06-01</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Mac application now requires 10.6 or later. If this is a big problem I can make a version for older Macs.
    <li>Incorporated many of Elena Malanushenko's scripts. Most of these are in the Script menu with new names, but the plotting strip chart scripts are now normal windows in the Inst menu (using the name Monitor, for consistency). The Test Actors script is now faster and more robust (it sends all commands at once, then reports replies as they come back).
    <li>Added a clear button, labelled "C", to most or all strip charts.
</ul>

<h3>1.1.2b2 2012-03-28</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Guider window
    <ul>
        <li>User Corr RA and Dec limits increased from +/-10 to +/-30"
        <li>User Corr Apply shows the state of each command sent in the status bar
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Guider window: User Corr Scale did not work (it was sending its command to the TCC instead of the guider).
</ul>


<h3>1.1.2b1 2011-11-08</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1476">1476</a> make guider failures more visible.
    <ul>
        <li>Guider and exposure state are shown in uppercase if the condition is an error.
        <li>The color of the word Guider and Exposure match the severity of the associated state.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Guider exposure state is now shown in the color appropriate to the severity of the state; formerly the severity was computed but ignored.
</ul>

<h3>1.1.1 2011-09-23</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>APOGEE QL exposure table title includes the exposure type.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1442">1442</a> exception in _utrDataCallback.
</ul>

<h3>1.1 2011-09-09</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>APOGEE: added support for APOGEE and APOGEE QuickLook

    <li>SOP window:
    <ul>
        <li>Added commands for APOGEE.
        <li>Bypassed systems are now shown in red (at Craig's suggestion) and you can now cancel bypass commands to re-enable the buttons.
        <li>Added alt field for Goto Gang Change.
        <li>SOP commands for BOSS are now shown with "(BOSS)". The parenthesis indicate that you leave out the "BOSS" when typing the commands on the command line.
        <li>Buttons that showed "Go To..." now show "Goto..." to simplify the mapping between the SOP window and sop commands: type what you see except lowercase the first letter and omit spaces and text in parenthesis.
        <li>Help strings for parameters now show the name you send to sop, not the displayed name, to simplify the mapping between the SOP window and sop commands. (This was already true of command buttons).
    </ul>

    <li>Guider Window:
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for refraction balance ratio guide parameter.
        <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/620">620</a>: add guider CCD temperature to Guider window.
        <li>You may apply guide parameter changes even if the guider is off.
        <li>Guider and exposure state are now displayed in color to indicate severity. The only "normal" guide state is "on" because we always run the guider while taking science data.
        <li>The exposure time widget always tracks the current value from the guider, it no longer tracks data from the currently displayed image. I hope this will be less confusing for users.
        <li>Updated to handle new "failed" guider and exposure states (thanks, Craig!).
    </ul>
    
    <li>Some windows now save state when you select Save Window Positions.
    <ul>
        <li>Log windows save filter information.
        <li>APOGEE saves which detail panels are open.
    </ul>

    <li>Log window:
    <ul>
        <li>Added filters "Commands", "Commands and Replies", "My Commands and Replies".
        <li>Show a CmdStarted and CmdDone message for each command (using data from the cmds actor).
    </ul>

    <li>MCP window: added status of APOGEE and MARVELS gang connector sensors.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>SOP did not shrink when stages were removed from commands.
    <li>TUI.Base.Wdg.FocusWdg had some minor bugs that were exposed by the new APOGEE Collimate controls.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>LogEntry objects now have a cmdID field for enhanced filtering.
    <li>Added code to the Alerts window to work around hub bug <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1181">1611</a>1611 (keys that have a list of 0 values are reported by the keys actor to have a single value of "None"). This avoids error messages when there are no active alerts or disabled alert rules.
</ul>

<h3>1.0+1 2011-04-04</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preliminary APOGEE window. It only shows some QuickLook data and has no controls.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Stop sending "plot display=..." as part of the guide on command. It is not longer needed and it caused an error message if the DISPLAY environment variable was not set.
</ul>

<h3>1.0 2011-03-15</h3>

<p>Release 1.0b17 as 1.0 with no changes.

<h3>1.0b17 2011-02-16</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Status window now shows the calibration and guide offsets.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Log window filtering showed all messages instead of None if the severity was set to None or the additional criteria were missing or incomplete.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b16 2011-02-03</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added an experimental Custom filter to the Log window to permit more complicated filter expressions. See the <a href="TUIMenu/LogWin.html">Log Window</a> documentation for details. There is no support as yet for saving or sharing expressions.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b15 2011-02-01</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a Center Up button to the Guider window.
    <li>Alerts window:
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the sort order to (severity, age, alert ID); formerly age was not considered.
        <li>Changed the two lists to always scroll to the top after the data changes, so the most important information is always visible.
    </ul>
    <li>The logs retain more information. Coupled with a separate improvement to BOSS (metrology is now reported using debug-level messages thanks to Craig Loomis) STUI logs should now show several hours of data.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b14 2011-01-12</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Cartridge 18 now shows up as cartridge 18 in the Status window. The engineering camera will show up as a mystery number because I have no idea what value the MCP reports.
    <li>The Guider now includes headings for the table in the correction panel, since the rollover help was insufficient.
    <li>The Guider now allows user-specified rotation correction up to +/- 100" (RA and Dec remain at +/-10").
    <li>The Guide Monitor now plots FWHM of in-focus guide probes.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Mac version includes matplotlib 1.0.1 which reduces the memory leak by 10x. I advise anyone running from source to upgrade your matplotlib.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The Guider could not display a plate image if there were no small postage stamps. Thanks to Craig Loomis for the bug report and fix.
    <li>The Guider's displayed scale measured error and applied correction were 100x too small.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b13 2010-12-23</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added clipped mean FWHM to Seeing chart in Guide Monitor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Requires RO package 2.7.
    <li>Modified for backward-incompatible StripChartWdg.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b12 2010-12-10</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Reduced rate of memory leakage by 10x by shifting the guide monitor's time axis every 10 seconds instead of every second. The display will be jerkier but you will still see all data. I'll restore the old behavior once the matplotlib memory leak is fixed.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b11 2010-12-08</h3>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1181">1181</a> STUI 1.0b10 cannot display the plate view for 55534/proc-gimg-1363.fits.
    <li>Fixed a minor memory leak in RO.Wdg.StripChartWdg; unfortunately a much larger memory leak remains due to a fundamental <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=560720&amp;aid=3124990&amp;group_id=80706">bug in matplotlib</a>.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b10 2010-11-22</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Changed the Guide window displayed error and correction to labels (which cannot be copied) from read-only entry widgets. This avoids beeps for NaNs and may be less confusing.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b9 2010-11-22</h3>

<p>Bug fix: the correction enable buttons in the Guider did not show the current state.

<h3>1.0b8 2010-11-22</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Guider window:
    <ul>
        <li>Added net guide correction
        <li>Added an indication of whether the most recent correction was applied
    </ul>
    <li>Scale is now shown as ((plate/nominal - 1) * 1e6) everywhere (Guider, Guide Monitor and Status). Reasonable corrections are thus in the 1s and 10s.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Eliminated an innocuous but annoying traceback that appeared in the error log after each guide exposure.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b7 2010-11-19</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Experimental support for entering guide corrections manually. Note: Paul Harding and I would greatly prefer to present scale change in units of fraction * 10^6 instead of fraction * 100. If we do this the old guider keywords and setScale command will still work in the old units but will be deprecated.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>MJD was off (I had the sign of the offset wrong).
    <li>Cartridge display was blank if the MCP and guider agreed.
    <li>My attempt to suppress "Warning: invalid value encountered in divide" by suppressing division warnings was insufficient. I now suppress all numpy warnings.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b6 2010-11-18</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added Stop button to SOP stages that can be aborted.
    <li>Improved the Guide Monitor (based on work by Craig Loomis).
    <li>Added target axis position, TAI date and SDSS MJD to the Status window.
    <li>Consolidated Inst ID and Cartridge in Status window; Cartridge now shows both the MCP and guider values if they disagree.
    <li>Added Calibration offsets to the Nudger window.
    <li>Renamed Object offset to Object Arc offset in the Nudger, Offset and Status windows and reorganized the associated help files to better consolidate information about types of offsets.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/618">618</a> need counterweight info in STUI MCP display.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b5 2010-10-18</h3>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/1097">1097</a> Enable/Disable buttons on Guider GUI send the wrong command.
    <li>Fixed a typo in the name of the Fiducials window (reported by Dan Oravitz).
</ul>

<h3>1.0b4 2010-10-01</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a Guide Monitor
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added TUI.Base.StripChartWdg, a convenient way to plot keyvars.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b3 2010-09-30</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a Fiducials window (based on a script by Elena Malanushenko) to show a log of fiducial crossings.
    <li>Added guide probe enable/disable widgets to the Guider window.
    <li>Guide plate image improvements:
    <ul>
        <li>Made the probe images larger
        <li>Improved placement of guide probe number labels
    </ul>
    <li>Interlocks display updated to match the modified interlocks.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed deprecated instrument model files. Always use TUI.Models.getModel(actor) to get a model.
    <li>Added fullGProbeBits to the guider model; this combined gprobeBits and gprobes and is intended as a workaround until the real gprobeBits keyword contains enable/disable info.
    <li>Increased the number of messages held by the central log repository from 2000 lines to 10,000 lines.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b2 2010-07-21</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>If you lose your connection or put your computer to sleep for long enough, TUI will test the connection and, if good, will attempt to refresh the data.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Log filtering based on command number would not show the outgoing command.
    <li>Would fail to start on unix due to an error in determining the name of the status window.
</ul>

<h3>1.0b1 2010-06-28</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Multiple log windows.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added logSource to the TUI model; this is a central repository for log data to support multiple log windows.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Log window
    <ul>
        <li>New lines are not highlighted when highlighting Actor or Actors.
        <li>Copied text includes filtered-out data.
        <li>Scrolling is irregular if there is a lot of filtered-out data.
    </ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/920">920</a> Fix "Guide" button.
</ul>

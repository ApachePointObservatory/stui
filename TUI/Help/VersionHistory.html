<h2><a href="index.html">STUI</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: works with MacOS X 10.6, 10.5 and 10.4 and is a universal binary.
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>No Windows releases are planned.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4 2010-02-19</h3>

<p>I had hoped 0.4 would contain complete guider support, but it looks as if the necessary guider bug fixes are too far out.

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The Alerts window's "Down Instrument" button did not work.
    <li>PR <href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/584">584</a> STUI Run_Commands script does not work. In fact the entire scripting system was broken due to relying on the dispatcher, keyword variables and command variables from RO instead of opscore. Fixed by adding ScriptRunner to opscore.actor and ScriptWdg to TUI.Base.Wdg.
    <li>Many test scripts did not work because they were not compatible with Twisted.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a7 2010-01-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Changed log timestamps and time in the Status window from UTC to TAI.
    <li>Added a "Down Instrument" button to the Alerts window.
    <li>Guider window:
    <ul>
        <li>Increased resolution of RA/Dec/Rotator correction from 0.1" to 0.01".
        <li><a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/557">Ticket 557</a>: Added simulation information (if simulating) to the Guider status at the top of the window.
    </ul>
    <li>Status window now shows guiding state.
    <li>Changed the default "Message Received" sound cue to avoid confusion with 3.5m TUI messages.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a6 2009-11-13</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Auto-downloads guide images if the Focus Plot window or Guider window are open. Formerly it only downloaded if the Guider window as open.
    <li>Guider window: added a display of the last correction applied (or recommended if that correction is disabled). These controls will eventually offer the ability to manually apply corrections as well. That is why you can edit the values, but right now it does you no good to do so.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Implemented controls to enable and disable guide probes but they cannot safely be made visible until ticket #433 is fixed: Please fix gprobeBits so it includes the "enabled" bit.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Focus Plot window: guide probe labels wrong if any probes missing or not in use.
    <li>Focus Plot window: fit was to the wrong equation.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a5 2009-11-06</h3>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The guider would fail to show a plate view if there was a postage stamp for a probe that did not exist. This is too picky.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a4 2009-11-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added seeing to the guider focus plot.
    <li>If the guider cannot create a plate image. it shows a message in the status bar.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The guider would fail to show a plate view if probe 1 was disabled.
    <li>The focus plot did not show the probe number for the last guide probe.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a3 2009-11-05</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a guider focus plot.
    <li>Added an X through disabled guide probes in the plate image.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a2-post 2009-11-04</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Updated guider documentation to better reflect reality.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a2 2009-11-04</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Renamed STUI's <a href="Tidbits/SpecialFiles.html">Special Files</a> as follows. This allow one to run TUI and STUI on the same computer without collisions. You must rename your files to restore your saved settings and additions.
    <ul>
        <li>TUIPrefs to STUIPrefs
        <li>TUIGeom to STUIGeom
        <li>TUIAdditions to STUIAdditions.
    </ul>
    <li>Guider display plate image improvements:
    <ul>
        <li>Increased density of image
        <li>Added probe number labels
        <li>Added scale and N/E axis
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Guide images with no postage stamps caused complaints in the error log.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4a1 2009-10-30</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added preliminary guider. The display still needs probe numbers and a scale and the guider needs needs many more guider controls.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3.1 2009-10-09</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a rudimentary BOSS status display.
    <li>New icon from a photo of the 2.5m telescope by Dan Long.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Stopped playing the Critical Alert sound cue for warning alerts.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3 2009-09-16</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added preliminary guider controls (Inst&gt;Guide). Limitations include:
    <ul>
        <li>No way to enable or disable specific guide probes.
        <li>Image download and display is untested (because the guider actor is not yet outputting the files keyword).
        <li>Image plate view is disabled because the the necessary metadata has not yet specified or supplied.
    </ul>
    <li>Switched to new sound cues by Elena and Dmitry for critical and serious alerts. Note that warning alerts are still silent by default (by design).
    <li>Improved the html help documentation, including removing outdated references to the 3.5m.
    <li>Changed name from TUISDSS to STUI.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Restored the missing Axis Halt sound preference.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2.1 2009-09-02</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added the potential for separate sound cues for critical, serious and warning alerts. However, at present the defaults are:
    <ul>
        <li>No sound for warning alerts. Observers should comment on whether this is a good choice.
        <li>SeriousAlert.wav is used for both serious and critical sound cues. This will be changed when I have time to work on sound cues or am given a good pair of cues for serious and critical alerts.
    </ul>
    <li>Added a new color for critical alerts (defaults to orange).
    <li>Added help pages for the Alerts, Interlocks and MCP windows.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.19.
    <li>Older versions of STUI will not work with RO 2.2.19. (This is due to a glitch in the log window that I have fixed in STUI 0.2.1.)
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2 2009-08-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preference to disable sound cues.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.18. This allows the Alerts window to not auto-scroll and allows users to control-click on X11 (a gesture used by the Interlocks display).
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest opscore. This allows parsing Int and Bits keyword values expressed as hex.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest actor dictionaries. This allows it to find the mcp keyword ffsCommandedOpen (which was formerly listed as ffsCommandedOn).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.1 2009-08-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Modified to adapt to a change in the alerts keyword from the alerts actor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed explicit setting of matplotlib "numerix" parameter because it is obsolete in the current release (0.99.0); users will have to make sure their matplotlib uses numpy and not some older, obsolete numeric package.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Added sound cue for serious alerts to the svn repository.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from STUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

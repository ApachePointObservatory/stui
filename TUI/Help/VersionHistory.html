<h2><a href="index.html">STUI</a>:Version History</h2>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: works with MacOS X 10.6, 10.5 and 10.4 and is a universal binary.
	<li>Unix: runs from source, so is compatible with all flavors of unix. See the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a> for the required version of Python and other libraries.
	<li>No Windows releases are planned.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.5.1 2010-03-12</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The log window is now visible by default.
    <li>The alerts window always shows disable alert rules.
    <li>Scripting tutorial and associated tutorial scripts rewritten for STUI.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/613">631</a> Paused timer has wrong "sign".
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added TUI.Models.getModel(actor). This makes all existing models available and is this is the recommended way to get a model. The old technique will result in a deprecation warning for now, and will eventually stop working altogether.
</ul>
    
<h3>Version 0.5.0 2010-03-11</h3>

<p>Warning for unix users:
<ul>
    <li>Requires RO Package version 2.3.4 and opscore trunk rev 107768 (the latter fixes some bugs in the script system).
</ul>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>The Status window now includes information about the currently mounted plug-plate cartridge.
    <li>The Users window now shows each client, version and system info.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/613">613</a> STUI guider plate view background levels are wrong.
    <li>Save As is broken in The Run_Commands script.
    <li>Command replies could be shown in the wrong color in status bars (fix adapted from TUI).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4 2010-02-19</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a Guider window.
    <li>Added a guider Focus Plot window.
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/392">392</a> Changed log timestamps and time in the Status window from UTC to TAI.
    <li>Added a "Down Instrument" button to the Alerts window.
    <li>Improved the reliability of sound cues. Warning for unix users: this was done by switching from the tkSnack to pygame sound library. This will require you to install pygame (and its dependencies) and a new version of RO. See the unix installation instructions for more information.
    <li>Renamed STUI's <a href="Tidbits/SpecialFiles.html">Special Files</a> as follows. This allow one to run TUI and STUI on the same computer without collisions. You must rename your files to restore your saved settings and additions.
    <ul>
        <li>TUIPrefs to STUIPrefs
        <li>TUIGeom to STUIGeom
        <li>TUIAdditions to STUIAdditions.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.sdss3.org/ticket/584">584</a> STUI Run_Commands script does not work. In fact the entire scripting system was broken due to relying on the dispatcher, keyword variables and command variables from RO instead of opscore. Fixed by adding ScriptRunner to opscore.actor and ScriptWdg to TUI.Base.Wdg.
    <li>Much sample code did not work because it was not compatible with Twisted.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3.1 2009-10-09</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a rudimentary BOSS status display.
    <li>New icon from a photo of the 2.5m telescope by Dan Long.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Stopped playing the Critical Alert sound cue for warning alerts.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3 2009-09-16</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added preliminary guider controls (Inst&gt;Guide). Limitations include:
    <ul>
        <li>No way to enable or disable specific guide probes.
        <li>Image download and display is untested (because the guider actor is not yet outputting the files keyword).
        <li>Image plate view is disabled because the the necessary metadata has not yet specified or supplied.
    </ul>
    <li>Switched to new sound cues by Elena and Dmitry for critical and serious alerts. Note that warning alerts are still silent by default (by design).
    <li>Improved the html help documentation, including removing outdated references to the 3.5m.
    <li>Changed name from TUISDSS to STUI.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Restored the missing Axis Halt sound preference.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2.1 2009-09-02</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added the potential for separate sound cues for critical, serious and warning alerts. However, at present the defaults are:
    <ul>
        <li>No sound for warning alerts. Observers should comment on whether this is a good choice.
        <li>SeriousAlert.wav is used for both serious and critical sound cues. This will be changed when I have time to work on sound cues or am given a good pair of cues for serious and critical alerts.
    </ul>
    <li>Added a new color for critical alerts (defaults to orange).
    <li>Added help pages for the Alerts, Interlocks and MCP windows.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.19.
    <li>Older versions of STUI will not work with RO 2.2.19. (This is due to a glitch in the log window that I have fixed in STUI 0.2.1.)
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2 2009-08-25</h3>

<p>Visible changes:
<ul>
    <li>Added a preference to disable sound cues.
</ul>

<p><b>Warning for those running from source</b> (rather than the Mac binary):
<ul>
    <li>This version of STUI requires RO 2.2.18. This allows the Alerts window to not auto-scroll and allows users to control-click on X11 (a gesture used by the Interlocks display).
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest opscore. This allows parsing Int and Bits keyword values expressed as hex.
    <li>Upgraded Mac version to latest actor dictionaries. This allows it to find the mcp keyword ffsCommandedOpen (which was formerly listed as ffsCommandedOn).
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.1 2009-08-06</h3>

<p>Visible changes:

<ul>
    <li>Modified to adapt to a change in the alerts keyword from the alerts actor.
</ul>

<p>Internal changes:
<ul>
    <li>Removed explicit setting of matplotlib "numerix" parameter because it is obsolete in the current release (0.99.0); users will have to make sure their matplotlib uses numpy and not some older, obsolete numeric package.
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Added sound cue for serious alerts to the svn repository.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1 2009-08-04</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first sdss version. Note that it was branched from STUI at around version 1.6, but I have merged some improvements in both directions.
</ul>

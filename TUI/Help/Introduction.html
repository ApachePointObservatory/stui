<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>	<title>TUI:Introduction</title></head><h2><a href="index.html">TUI</a>:Introduction</h2><p>TUI is a user interface for the APO 3.5m telescope, the replacement for Remark. It runs on unix, MacOS X and Windows.<h2>Starting and Stopping TUI</h2><ul>	<li>On unix, type "tui" at the command-line prompt. On MacOS X or Windows, double-click TUI. If TUI is not yet installed, see the <a href="Installation.html">installation instructions</a>.		<li>If you have never run TUI before, set up your preferences before proceeding:		<ul>		<li>Select <code>Preferences</code> from the TUI menu.		<li>Under Connections set your User Name.				<li>Under Exposures select a Save To directory for science and guider images. Your images will be placed in suitable subdirectories with program name and date.				<p>You may select whether to auto-ftp science images and how to auto-number you rimages.				<li>Look through the other preferences.				<li>Press Select <code>Save</code> to save all changes. If you prefer to try things out first, press <code>Apply</code> to use your changes but not save them.	</ul>		<li>Connect to APO.	<ul>		<li>Select <code>Connect</code> from the TUI menu.		<li>Enter your program ID (e.g. UW01) and the associated password. If you didn't save a user name in preferences, type that in as well. Call your Observing Specialist at APO if you don't know your password.				<li>Press the <code>Connect</code> button.				<li>The displays should update to show current information.	</ul>		<li>To save your window positions and remember which windows to open at startup, select <code>Save Window Positions</code> from the TUI menu. You will probably want to do this after you have used TUI for a little while and have a feel for your favorite screen layout.		<li>When you are finished with TUI, select <code>Quit</code> from the TUI menu.</ul><h2>Message window</h2><ul>	<li>You can send messages to other users using the Message window. If you don't see this window, select the Misc&gt;Message menu item.	<li>Type your message in the <b>lower field</b> and hit &lt;return&gt;.	<li>Messages from all TUI users appear in the upper portion of the window.</ul><h2>Monitoring the Telescope</h2><ul>	<li>You can see what's going on using the Status, Sky and Focal Plane windows. The Status window is always displayed. The Sky and Focal Plane windows are open by default and can be re-opened or brought to the front by selecting the TCC&gt;Sky and TCC&gt;Focal Plane menu items.</ul><h2>Sky window</h2><ul>	<li>The Sky window (TCC&gt;Sky menu item) shows the following:	<ul>		<li>O: the current position of the telescope.		<li>+: the target position. This matches the current position except during a slew.		<li>X: the position, if any, set in the Slew window.		<li>â€¢: objects in your catalog(s), if any.	</ul>	<li>The inner az/alt grid shows the sky as seen by the telescope.	<li>The outer spiral shows the azimuth wrap; if the current position on the azimuth wrap gets close to either end of the spiral, you are in danger of tracking into a limit.</ul><h2>Focal Plane window</h2><ul>	<li>The Focal Plane window (TCC&gt;Focal Plane menu item) shows the orientation of the sky and horizon relative to the focal plane. This can be very useful for predicting which way an offset will occur. It can also help diagnose the causes of pointing errors.	<li>The Focal Plane window also shows the rotator wrap as a spiral around the outer edge. If the rotator position approaches either end of the spiral, you are in danger of tracking into a limit.</ul><h2>Slew window</h2><ul>	<li>To slew the telescope, use the Slew window (TCC&gt;Slew menu item).	<li>See <a href="#EnteringPosition">Entering Positions, Times and Offsets</a> below for hints on entering positions.	<li>You will usually want FK5 or ICRS coordinates, depending on your object catalog. ICRS is simply FK5 J2000.	<li>The usual choice for rotation is 0&deg; Object. This keeps north up on your instrument. Another common choise is 0&deg; Horizon, which keeps atmospheric dispersion along the slit of a spectrograph.	<li>The name is optional but helpful for other users.	<li>To select a catalog item, either double click it in the Sky window or select it from the Catalog menu in the Slew window. In either case, this simply fills in the information in the Slew window. You still have to push the Slew button to slew.	<li>The history menu shows you your past slews. Select one to set that slew up again.	<li>Advanced options are available via a column of buttons labelled Options. Click an option button to expose the associated settings. Click it again to hide the settings and disable the options.</ul><h2>Offset window</h2><ul>	<li>The offset window allows you to offset the telescope (TCC&gt;Offset menu item).	<li>Absolute offsets replace any existing offset. Relative offsets are added to any existing offset.	<li>See <a href="#EnteringPosition">Entering Positions, Times and Offsets</a> below for hints on entering offsets.	<li>The Focal Plane window can help you figure out which direction an offset will move things.	<li>Object offsets are specified as distance on the sky, i.e. they are not simply added to the object position and you don't have to think about compensating for cos(dec).	<li>A new offset "Object (XY)" is an object offset specified in instrument X-Y coordinates. This is useful for Echelle users and others cases where the sky rotates on the instrument. If that is you, please read <a href="Telescope/OffsetTypes.html">about offsets</a> to help you choose; it may improve your pointing!	<li>Boresight offsets are what Remark called Instrument offsets. Whatever you call them, they were often used inappropriately. If you use the Echelle or any other instrument where the sky rotates on the instrument, please read <a href="Telescope/OffsetTypes.html">about offsets</a>.</ul><h2>Using Instruments</h2><ul>	<li>Each instrument has two windows: one for configuration and one for exposures. To open the configuration window, select the instrument in the Inst menu. To open the exposure window, click <code>Expose...</code> in the configuration window.	<li>To configure an instrument, bring up its configuration window and press <code>Show Config</code> to display the user-settable controls. Set the controls as desired and click <code>Apply</code>.	<li>The current configuration should always be correct. However, the user-settable controls can get out of date if you leave them exposed. To bring the user-settable controls up to date, press the <code>Current</code> button or else hide and re-display the user-settable controls by pressing <code>Hide Config</code> and <code>Show Config</code>.</ul><h2>Guiding</h2><p>You can control various guiders and slitviewers from the Guide menu. Guide windows have a number of hidden controls and shortcuts, so I strongly recommend you read the <a href="Guiding/index.html">Guiding Manual</a> before trying to use them.<h2><a name="EnteringPosition"></a>Entering Positions, Times and Offsets</h2><ul>	<li>Position may be entered as <code>&deg;:':"."</code> or <code>&deg;:'.'</code> or <code>&deg;.&deg;</code> (<code>h:m:s</code> or <code>h:m.m</code> or <code>h:m:s.s</code> for HA). For example: 1.5 and 1:30 both mean 1 1/2 degrees. To enter a colon, type <code>:</code> <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> or keypad <code>/</code>. The displayed units update as you add each colon.	<li>In a similar vein, exposure times may be entered as s.s or m:s.s or h:m:s.s and offsets as "." or ':"." or &deg;:':".", depending on how many colons you enter. For example: 150 and 2:30 both mean 2 1/2 minutes.	<li>You must type. Remark's thumb wheel controls are gone.	<li>You can enter your data ahead of time in a <a href="Telescope/UserCatalogs.html">user catalog</a>. The format has changed slightly from Remark, but is more flexible and more forgiving. If your old Remark catalogs don't specify proper motion then you can use them "as is".</ul><h2>Help</h2><ul>	<li>Many windows display help in a status bar near the bottom of the window. Simply place the mouse pointer over a control to display its help.	<li><A HREF="index.html">Detailed on-line help</A> is accessible from from most controls and displays. You are reading one page of this help right now. To jump directly to help for a particular control, bring up its contextual menu (right-click or on Mac control-click) and select Help. This will open the help in your default web browser (warning: if you have multiple desktops the window may open in a different desktop). Every page, including this one, has a navigation bar at the top and there are plenty of links in the text itself.</ul></body></html>

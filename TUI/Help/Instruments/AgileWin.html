Agile-specific items are described here.<h3>Sound Cues</h3><p>Agile is a frame-transfer camera, so the end of each exposure marks the start of the next exposure. Thus the "exposure ends" sound cue is never played. (Eventually I hope to play it once at the end of an exposure sequence.) Also, it is capable of taking very short exposures, and the repetitive "exposure begins" sound cue would be maddening if played for every exposure. So the sound cue will be played once every 30 seconds at maximum.<h3>Exposure Control</h3><ul>    <li><a name="Gain"></a><b>Gain</b>: CCD amplifier gain; one of Low, Medium or High    <li><a name="ReadRate"></a><b>Read Rate</b>: CCD pixel readout rate: one of Fast or Slow. This is a crucial parameter for short exposures because your minimum exposure time is the image readout rate plus a small overhead for image file handling. If you find your exposure is rejected because the exposure time is too short then you can try increasing the readout rate, increasing the bin factor, reducing overscan or windowing the image.</ul><h3>Environmental Status</h3><ul>    <li><a name="Camera"></a><b>Camera</b>: state of camera connection. This is important because the camera is disconnected and reconnected after every exposure sequence (to work around a data corrupting bug in Princeton Instruments' PVCam library) and you cannot command an exposure unless the camera is connected. It takes about 30 seconds for reconnection. If you find it annoying then please complain to Princeton Instruments; maybe if enough people do so they will actually fix it.    <blockquote>    <p>Call PI at 609-587-9797 and ask to speak to Rob Allen (leave a message) or email him at RAllen@piacton.com. Agile is a VersArray 1024 Frame-Transfer camera with a USB interface on a Linux system. The bug is that if the camera will corrupt data with a band of zeros if used to take multiple sequences of exposures without closing the camera between sequences. Russell Owen first reported it 2008-12 (or perhaps a bit earlier) and included simple test code that reproduces the problem.    </blockquote>	<li><a name="CCDTemp"></a><b>CCD Temp</b>: the current CCD temperature. If you click on this you show/hide more temperature-related information.</ul><p>See also the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/Instruments/Agile/">Agile documentation at APO</a>.</body></html>

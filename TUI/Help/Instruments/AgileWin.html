Agile-specific controls are described here. Agile-specific controls include:<ul>    <li><a name="Gain"></a><b>Gain</b>: CCD amplifier gain; one of Low, Medium or High    <li><a name="ReadRate"></a><b>Read Rate</b>: CCD pixel readout rate: one of Fast or Slow. This is a crucial parameter for short exposures because your minimum exposure time is the image readout rate plus a small overhead for image file handling. If you find your exposure is rejected because the exposure time is too short then you can try increasing the readout rate, increasing the bin factor, reducing overscan or windowing the image.    <li><a name="ExtSync"></a><b>Ext Sync</b>: trigger readout using the high precision external sync pulse, or using the much less accurate internal timing? The external sync pulse is driven by a GPS receiver and is strongly recommended unless you really don't care about the exact time of each frame. Note that the external sync pulse cannot be used for bias exposures, so the control will be disabled.</ul><h3>Environmental Status</h3><ul>	<li><a name="CCDTemp"></a><b>CCD Temp</b>: the current CCD temperature. If you click on this you show/hide more temperature-related information.</ul></body></html>

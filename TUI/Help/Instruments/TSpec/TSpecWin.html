The forms of sampling are:    <ul>        <li><b>Fowler</b>: the array is read out several times at the start of the integration and then again several times after integration is finished. The reads are all non-destructive and allow read-noise and fixed pattern noise to be     effectively reduced for a single frame.        <li><b>Sample-Up-The-Ramp (SUTR)</b>: the array is read non-destructively at regular intervals during the integration. For each pixel a fit is produced to provide an intensity for that pixel as well as fit (pixel) quality.    </ul>        <li><a name="Slit"></a><b>Slit</b>: the slitwheel position.        <li><a name="TipTiltMode"></a><b>Tip-Tilt Mode</b>: mode of the tip-tilt fine adjustment system for the imaging array. For science observing the mode should be one of:    <ul>        <li><b>ClosedLoop</b>: if using tip-tilt or you trust the system to be stable        <li><b>Off</b>: if you are not using tip-tilt and don't trust the system.    </ul>    <blockquote>        <p><b>Warning</b>: turning the tip-tilt system on or off is a <b>manual</b> operation; it <b>cannot</b> be done from TUI.    </blockquote>    <li><a name="ArrayPower"></a><b>Array Power</b>: is the imaging array power on or off? The control is hidden unless you push the "Array Power" button because one rarely needs to power down the array.	<li><a name="Environment"></a><b>Environment</b>: the button controls whether to show or hide pressure and various temperatures. An OK to the right of the button means that the pressure and all temperatures are acceptable.</ul><p>Below the status and configuration items is a status bar that shows help and the state of the currently executing configuration command.<p>The buttons along the bottom are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="CmdButtons"></a><b>Expose...</b>: opens the separate TSpec <a href="../ExposeWin.html">Expose window</a>.	<li><a name="CmdButtons"></a><b>Show Config</b>: show or hide the configuration controls.	<p>The following are only available if the configuration controls are showing:	<li><a name="CmdButtons"></a><b>Apply</b>: apply the requested changes by sending a series of commands to TSpec.	<li><a name="CmdButtons"></a><b>X</b>: cancel your pending configuration changes. The current command is allowed to finish, but any subsequent commands are flushed.	<li><a name="CmdButtons"></a><b>Current</b>: reset all configuration widgets to the current state of the instrument.</ul></body></html>

The status portion is always displayed. The configuration controls are hidden by default.	<li>The NICFPS <a href="../ExposeWin.html">Expose window</a> controls and displays exposure sequences. Note: you can stop a NICFPS exposure but you cannot pause or abort one. Thus the Abort button is missing and the Pause button will pause the exposure sequence after the current exposure finishes.</ul></body></html>

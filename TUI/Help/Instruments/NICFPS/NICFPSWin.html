Once the instrument builders have more time with the instrument we plan to refine the controls.<p>Pushing the "Show Config" button displays configuration controls (each to the right of its corresponding item of status).<ul>	<li>Controls with a colored background will be changed when you hit Apply.	<li>The contextual menu on each control can return that control to the current setting of the instrument.</ul><p>The status and configuration items are as follows.<ul>	<li><a name="Filter"></a><b>Filter</b>. the current set of filters. NICFPS has 3 filters, but each common combination of filters has a name, which is shown here.	<li><a name="EtalonInBeam"></a><b>Etalon</b>: shows whether the Etalon is In or Out of the beam. When the configuration control is set to "In", the following Etalon controls are visible:	<ul>		<li><a name="EtalonX"></a><b>X Spacing</b>: x position of the etalon.		<li><a name="EtalonY"></a><b>Y Spacing</b>: y position of the etalon.		<li><a name="EtalonZ"></a><b>Z Spacing</b>: z spacing of the etalon. Z is along the beam, and thus most directly controls the wavelength.	</ul>	<li><a name="Environment"></a><b>Environment</b>: the button controls whether to show or hide pressure and various temperatures. An OK to the right of the button means that the pressure and all temperatures are acceptable.</ul><p>Below the items is a status bar that shows help and the state of the currently executing configuration command.<p>The buttons along the bottom are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="Expose"></a><b>Expose...</b>: open the NICFPS's <a href="../ExposeWin.html">expose window</a>.	<li><a name="Congif"></a><b>Show/Hide Config</b>: show or hide the congiguration controls.	<p>The following are only available if the configuration controls are showing:	<li><a name="Apply"></a><b>Apply</b>: apply the requested changes, if any.	<li><a name="Current"></a><b>Current</b>: set all configuration controls to the current state of the instrument.</ul></body></html>

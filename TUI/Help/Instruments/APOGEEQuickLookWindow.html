Output includes:<h3>Exposure Table</h3><p>A table of showing finished and predicted exposures for the current plate, including cumulative exposure time and (where appropriate) cumulative S/N.<h3>Signal to Noise vs. UTR Read Graph</h3><p>A graph of S/N for the current exposure vs. up-the-ramp read number. This is intended to help you predict how many more UTR reads are required for the exposure to have acceptable S/N. The graph also shows a fit of the most recent data.<p>Note: the range of data displayed is dictated by the APOGEE QuickLook (apogeeql) actor.</body></html>

This window is primarily intended for status monitoring and engineering; for normal observing APOGEE should be controlled via the <a href="SOPWindow.html">SOP window</a><h3>Telemetry</h3><p>Shows the state of vacuum, liquid nitrogen and temperatures. Also shows array power if Off (typically it is ? or On). A summary is printed to the right of the Telemetry button. Press the Telemetry button to show or hide the details. <h3>Collimator</h3><p>The controls are usually hidden because the collimator is typically only moved during engineering. Press the Collimator button to show or hide the controls.<p>You may apply relative offsets to the following (absolute moves are not supported by the APOGEE ICC):<ul>    <li>Piston: positive values move the collimator closer to the instrument.    <li>Pitch: positive values tip the beam down.    <li>Yaw: positive values tip the beam to the right, as seen by the collimator.</ul><p>To the right of the Collimator button is a summary field that shows one of the following:<ul>    <li><b>OK</b>: the collimator controller is working and no limit switch has fired.    <li><b>Off</b> indicates that the APOGEE ICC cannot communicate with the collimator controller. This is a potentially serious condition.    <li><b>Limits rev1 fwd1 rev2 fwd2 rev3 fwd3</b> indicates at least one limit switch has fired or is in an unknown state. The values are the state of the reverse=home and forward limit switches for each actuator. The states are 0: not activated, 1: activated, ?: unknown. It is only shown if one or more switches is activated or unknown. If the reverse and forward switches are both activated for one actuator then the text is red because this indicates a serious failure.</ul><h3>Dither</h3><p>Dither is typically toggled between A and B before each exposure. You may specify the dither as a named position or an explicit value in pixels (select Any in the pop-up menu). Note: if you specify a pixel value that matches A or B the pop-up menu will continue to say Any. This is intentional (it makes sure the right command is sent to the ICC).<p>To the right of the current dither display (near the top of the window) is a summary field that shows one of the following:<ul>    <li><b>OK</b>: the dither controller is working and no limit switch is pressed.    <li><b>Off</b> indicates that the APOGEE ICC cannot communicate with the dither controller. This is a very serious condition since one must change dither for most data collecting.    <li><b>Limits <i>rev</i> <i>fwd</i></b> indicates that one or both limit switches is pressed or is in an unknown state. Shows the state of the reverse=home and forward limit switches. The states are 0: not activated, 1: activated, ?: unknown. If both switches are activated the text is red because this indicates a serious failure.</ul><h3>Exp Type</h3><p>Controls the exposure type. At the request of the APOGEE team you must reset it for each exposure.<h3>Num Reads</h3><p>Controls the number of up-the-ramp reads. The associated exposure time is displayed to the right.</body></html>

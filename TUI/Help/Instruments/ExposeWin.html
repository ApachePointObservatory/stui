Details differ for each instrument, but the basics are identical. To open the expose window for a given instrument, bring up that instrument's main window, then press the Expose... button along the bottom.<p>The top panel shows the status of the current exposure sequence (regardless of who started it).<ul>	<li><a name="SeqStatus"></a>Seq Status: information about the current sequence	<li><a name="ExpStatus"></a>Exp Status: information about the current exposure	<li><a name="UserStatus"></a>User: who started the current sequence; if its your sequence then the text says "Me"; if it's a collaborator (somebody logged in with the same program name as you) then the next indicates that.	<li><a name="FileNameStatus"></a>File: the file name for the current exposure, or the most recent exposure if not exposing. For instruments with more than one camera (e.g. DIS) there is a separate line for each camera.	<li><a name="CommentStatus"></a>Comment: the user's comment, if any. Note: as I write this TUI has no way of getting this information from the hub; until that is fixed this line will remain blank.</ul><p>The bottom portion shows the input and command widgets:<ul>	<li><a name="Prefs"></a>Prefs: exposure-related preferences	<ul>		<li>Auto Get: controls whether images for this instrument are automatically downloaded to your computer. You may toggle this checkbox without affecting other instruments. However, you may set the corresponding global exposure preference controls all instruments at once (e.g. via the More button).		<li>View Image: controls whether to display downloaded images in ds9. Disabled if Auto Get unchecked. Like Auto Get, this checkbutton only controls the setting for this instrument. Use the corresponding global exposure preference to control all instruments at once (e.g. via the More... button).		<li>More...: shows the <a href="../../TUIMenu/Preferences.html#Exposures">global exposure preferences</a>. Please remember to Save or Apply any changes you make to global preferences.	</ul>	<li><a name="TypeInput"></a>Object, Flat, Dark, Bias: the type of exposure. Some instruments (e.g. nicfps) do not support all of these types.	<li><a name="ExpTimeInput"></a>Time: the length of the exposure, in seconds, min:sec or hrs:min:sec, depending on how many colons you enter.	<li><a name="NumExpInput"></a>#Exp: the number of exposures to take in this sequence.	<li><a name="CameraInput"></a>Cameras: (only present for instruments such as DIS that have more than one camera). The camera(s) from which to save images. At least one camera must be specified.	<li><a name="FileNameInput"></a>File Name: the name of the your file. The name is relative to your program's directory and the file number and extension are automatically added. For example if the file name is "mysubdir/test" and the file number is 27 then the next image will be <code><i>your program's directory</i>/mysubdir/test.0027.fits</code>. A leading slash will be ignored; files are always placed in your program's directory.	<li><a name="CommentInput"></a>Comment: an optional comment about the exposures. This information is saved to the FITS header (truncated if necessary) and displayed to other users.</ul><p>The penultimate line is the status bar; as usual it shows replies to any commands you personally start, as well as help and error messages if you try to enter something invalid.<p>And the command buttons take their appointed place along the bottom:<ul>	<li><a name="StartButton"></a>Start: start the exposure sequence. Note: if your exposure sequence would overwrite an existing image the sequence is immediately rejected. To fix the problem, figure out what went wrong with your file naming scheme and change the file name or sequence number accordingly.	<li>Pause, Stop and Abort allow you to pause or halt the exposure sequence. Most instruments allow you to pause or abort an integration, but any other camera operation will probably have to finish before your request can be processed.	<ul>		<li><a name="PauseButton"></a>Pause/Resume: pause/resume the current sequence.		<li><a name="StopButton"></a>Stop: halt the exposure sequence and <b>save</b> the current image if one is being taken.		<li><a name="AbortButton"></a>Abort: halt the exposure sequence and <b>discard</b> the image if one is being taken.		<p>Notes:		<li>You are allowed to pause or halt any collaborator's sequences. Please use with caution!		<li>The Pause, Stop and Abort buttons highlight immediately after you press Start. This allows you to immediately halt, in case you realize you made a mistake right after you hit "Start". However, it has the potentially annoying side effect that the buttons will momentarily enable if your exposure sequence is immediately rejected.	</ul>	<li>Config...: opens the window that displays and allows you to change the instrument configuration.</ul></body></html>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head>   <title>TUI:Instruments:Expose window</title></head><body><h2><a href="../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Instruments</a>:Expose window</h2><p>This describes the exposure window used by each instrument (the graphical interface for the hub's <code>expose</code> command). Details differ for each instrument, but the basics are identical. To open the expose window for a given instrument, bring up that instrument's main window, then press the Expose... button along the bottom.<p>The top panel shows the status of the current exposure sequence (regardless of who started it).<ul>	<li><a name="SeqStatus"></a>Seq Status: information about the current sequence	<li><a name="ExpStatus"></a>Exp Status: information about the current exposure	<li><a name="UserStatus"></a>User: who started the current sequence; if its your sequence then the text says "Me"; if it's a collaborator (somebody logged in with the same program name as you) then the next indicates that.	<li><a name="FileNameStatus"></a>File: the file name for the current exposure, or the most recent exposure if not exposing. For instruments with more than one camera (e.g. DIS) there is a separate line for each camera.	<li><a name="CommentStatus"></a>Comment: the user's comment, if any. Note: as I write this TUI has no way of getting this information from the hub; until that is fixed this line will remain blank.</ul><p>The bottom portion shows the input and command widgets:<ul>	<li><a name="TypeInput"></a>Object, Flat, Dark, Bias: the type of exposure. Some instruments (e.g. nicfps) do not support all of these types.	<li><a name="ExpTimeInput"></a>Time: the length of the exposure, in seconds, min:sec or hrs:min:sec, depending on how many colons you enter.	<li><a name="NumExpInput"></a>#Exp: the number of exposures to take in this sequence.	<li><a name="CameraInput"></a>Cameras: (only present for instruments such as DIS that have more than one camera). The camera(s) from which to save images. At least one camera must be specified.	<li><a name="FileNameInput"></a>File: the name of the file. The name is relative to your program's root directory and must exclude the sequence number and extension. For example if name = "mysubdir/test" and sequence number = 1 (see below) then the next image will be <code><i>program-specific root</i>/mysubdir/test0001.fits</code>. A leading slash is optional and has no effect; files are always placed relative to your program-specific subdirectory.	<li><a name="SeqInput"></a>Auto Seq: controls the numbering of image files. For example, suppose you take 2 images named "bias", 2 named "flat" and another "bias". Numbering by file yields: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0001.fits, flat.0002.fits, bias.0003.fits. Numbering by directory yields: bias.0001.fits, bias.0002.fits, flat.0003.fits, flat.0004.fits, bias.0005.fits.	<li><a name="CommentInput"></a>Comment: an optional comment about the exposures. This information is saved to the FITS header (truncated if necessary) and displayed to other users.	<li><a name="Prefs"></a>Prefs: the current setting of key Exposures preferences. For more information, read about <a href="../TUIMenu/PreferencesWin.html#Exposures">Exposures Preferences</a>.</ul><p>The penultimate line is the status bar; as usual it shows replies to any commands you personally start, as well as help and error messages if you try to enter something invalid.<p>And the command buttons take their appointed place along the bottom:<ul>	<li><a name="StartButton"></a>Start: start the exposure sequence. Note: if your exposure sequence would overwrite an existing image the sequence is immediately rejected. To fix the problem, figure out what went wrong with your file naming scheme and change the file name or sequence number accordingly.	<li>Pause, Stop and Abort allow you to pause or halt the exposure sequence. Most instruments allow you to pause or abort an integration, but any other camera operation will probably have to finish before your request can be processed.	<ul>		<li><a name="PauseButton"></a>Pause/Resume: pause/resume the current sequence.		<li><a name="StopButton"></a>Stop: halt the exposure sequence and <b>save</b> the current image if one is being taken.		<li><a name="AbortButton"></a>Abort: halt the exposure sequence and <b>discard</b> the image if one is being taken.		<p>Notes:		<li>You are allowed to pause or halt any collaborator's sequences. Please use with caution!		<li>The Pause, Stop and Abort buttons highlight immediately after you press Start. This allows you to immediately halt, in case you realize you made a mistake right after you hit "Start". However, it has the potentially annoying side effect that the buttons will momentarily enable if your exposure sequence is immediately rejected.	</ul>	<li>Config...: opens the window that displays and allows you to change the instrument configuration.</ul><p>Note that automatic ftp of files is controlled by the Auto FTP panel in Preferences. In early versions of TUI there were also auto ftp controls in exposure windows, but those are gone.</body></html>

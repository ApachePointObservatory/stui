The SOP window supports a few of the most commonly used sop commands. More may be added on request, and some may be placed in a new panel at some point.<h2>Controls</h2><h3>Commands</h3><p>Each supported sop commands has its own panel in the SOP window. Each command has its own buttons to start, modify and abort (X) the command. In addition, if the command has stages or parameters then Current and Default buttons are offered to restore the current and default settings.<p>Each command and stage has a status area to the left that shows what the command is going. This status is entirely based on the <i>command</i>State keyword.<p>The <b>Load Cartridge</b> command is special because it is a guider command, not a sop command. The guider does not make any state information available for the command, so no status area is shown.<h3>Bypass</h3><p>To temporarily bypass a system, press <b>Bypass...</b> and select the desired system from the dialog box. All bypassed systems are shown to the right of Bypass..., each as a button; press the button to clear that bypass (to stop bypassing that system).</body></html>

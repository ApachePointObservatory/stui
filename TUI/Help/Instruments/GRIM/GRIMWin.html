If you have a slit (Image and View Slit modes), two addition choices are available: f/20 short and f/20 long.	<li><a name="Filter"></a><b>Filter</b>: the chosen filter.</ul><p>Below the items is a status bar that shows help and the state of the currently executing configuration command.<p>The buttons along the bottom are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="Expose"></a><b>Expose...</b>: open GRIM's <a href="../ExposeWin.html">expose window</a>.	<li><a name="Congif"></a><b>Show/Hide Config</b>: show or hide the congiguration controls.	<p>The following are only available if the configuration controls are showing:	<li><a name="Apply"></a><b>Apply</b>: apply the requested changes, if any.	<li><a name="Current"></a><b>Current</b>: set all configuration controls to the current state of the instrument.</ul><p>Notes:<ul><li>To take a dark, use the Dark mode. Do not simply insert the blank off filter.<li>GRIM also supports polarimetry but it is tricky to use. At APO request TUI does not try to support it directly. If you wish to do polarimetry, please use the command line interface to configure GRIM (the Log window may be used to enter text commands).</ul></body></html>

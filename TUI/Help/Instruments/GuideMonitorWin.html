<p>A strip chart showing various aspects of guiding, including:

<h3>Axes</h3>

<p>Shows the current guide offset and the corrections reported by the guider. Eventually I hope these will be Az, Alt and Rot and will all come from the TCC's GuideOff keyword, but right now that is only true for the rotator and the other two axes are adjusted in RA/Dec using arc offsets and reported by the TCC's ObjArcOff keyword.

<h3>Seeing</h3>

<p>Seeing is the predicted best seeing available if the telescope were perfectly focussed. At some point the guider will start reporting the actual measured FWHM at the current focus, and that will be added to this graph.

<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>Shows the user-specified focus offset (which is the value the guider adjusts to maintain focus), in &micro;m. The net value is reported by TCC's SecFocus keyword.

<h3>Scale Factor</h3>

<p>((plate scale/nominal scale) - 1) * 1e6; larger values indicate higher resolution, e.g. more pixels/arcsec. The net value comes from the TCC's ScaleFac keyword, which reports (plate scale/nominal scale).

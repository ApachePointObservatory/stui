The angle is measured from instrument axis X to object axis 1 (East for an RA/Dec coordinate system). Thus for an RA/Dec coordinate system a rotation angle of 0 puts North up (along instrument Y) and 90 puts East up.</li>		<li><a name="Horizon"></a>Horizon: the horizon is held at a fixed orientation on the instrument. The angle is from instrument X to the direction of increasing azimuth. Thus 0 puts the horizon left/right on the instrument (increasing azimuth to the right) and 90 puts the horizon vertically (increasing azimuth up).</li>		<li><a name="Physical"></a>Physical: idealized rotator mechanical position. Like Mount but the angle may be put in a more convenient wrap and it may differ from Mount by an offset, a sign or even possibly (but very unlikely) a scale factor. For setting the rotator to a known orientation with no question about wrap, always use Mount.</li>		<li><a name="Mount"></a>Mount: the angle used by the rotator axis controller. The angle is taken "as is" with no other wrap possible. This is the only safe way to send an instrument to its exchange position (typically 0 degrees Mount angle).</li>		<li><a name="None"></a>None: do not rotate. If the rotator is presently moving, it will be halted at approximately its current position. Typically only used for instruments that have no rotator; if you want to halt the rotator at a known angle, use Mount or Physical instead.</li></ul></body></html>

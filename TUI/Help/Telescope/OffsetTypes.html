The components are in the user-specified coordinate system for the object (typically RA, Dec), and are used as follows: The length along the great circle equals the magnitude of the net arc offset vector. Arc offsets are useful for moving a different portion of your object or a different nearby object onto the <a href="#Boresight">boresight</a>. They are also used for drift scanning.	Warnings:	<ul>	<li>The TCC calls these "arc" offsets. The TCC has an older, deprecated, offset called "object" that is directly additive (so you have to worry about cos(dec)). "Arc" was felt to be too poor a name to use in TUI so we decided to risk confusion and use the term "object offset" to mean two different things.	<li>Because object (TCC arc) offsets are used for drift scanning, orientation of the instrument in object rotation mode is determined at the un-offset position (as drift scanning requires). Also, object offset velocity is compensated for refraction to maintain a constant scan rate across the focal plane. This results in a slight variation in rate on the sky depending on orientation and altitude.	</ul>	<li><a name="ObjectXY"></a><b>Object XY</b> this is identical to the object offset except that it has been rotated to align along the instrument x-y axes. It is the user coordsys (e.g. RA/Dec) components of the offset that are saved as a constant, so if the field of view rotates, a given Object XY offset will gradually change over time.		<li><a name="Boresight"></a><b>Boresight</b> specifies the position of the object on the instrument. The axes of the offset are the x-y axes of the instrument, and 0,0 is nominally the center of the instrument. If the rotator is not rotating with the sky then the boresight is the center of rotation of the sky on the instrument. <b>Warning:</b> boresight position is ignored (but recorded and a warning is issued) for Physical or Mount coordinates. This is because Physical and Mount coordinates describe the position of the mount, not of the object; in fact Boresight position is one of the main components of the conversion from Observed to Physical coordinates.</ul><p>The following offsets are typically not directly set by the user, but it will eventually offer some convenient way of clearing them:<ul>		<li><a name="Calibration"></a><b>Calibration</b> (primarily for engineering use) changes the local pointing correction (normally set automatically by a pointing error sequence). There are three axes: azimuth, altitude and rotator. The offset is in telescope mount coordinates. <b>Warning:</b> ignored (but recorded and a warning is issued) for mount coordinates. This is because it is considered a correction for physical imperfection, and hence is applied during the conversion from physical to mount. If the object is specified in mount coordinates then the azimuth and altitude components are ignored; if the rotator is specified in mount coordinates then the rotator component is ignored.		<li><a name="GuideCorrection"></a><b>Guide Correction</b> (primarily for engineering use) changes the guiding correction (normally set automatically by guiding). There are three axes: azimuth, altitude and rotator. The offset is in telescope mount coordinates. <b>Warning:</b> ignored (but recorded and a warning issued) for mount coordinates; see calibration offsets for details.</ul></body></html>

This window cannot be closed. Items in the various menus are described <a href="../index.html">here</a>.<p><a name="NetPos">The top panel shows user-specified information about the current target and also the progress of slews:<ul>	<li><b>Name</b>: object name	<li>Obj Pos1/2 (e.g. RA/Dec): net object position. including object and arc offsets.	<li><b>CSys</b>: <a href="../Telescope/CoordSys.html">coordinate system</a>.	<li><b>Rot</b>: user-specified rotator angle and <a href="../Telescope/RotTypes.html">type of rotation</a>.</ul><p><a name="Offsets">The next panel shows certain offsets:<ul>	<li><a href="../Telescope/OffsetTypes.html#Object">Obj Off</a>: the current object offset.	<li><a href="../Telescope/OffsetTypes.html#ObjectXY">Obj Off XY</a>: the current object offset rotated to instrument xy coordinates (this may vary if the field rotates).	<li><a href="../Telescope/OffsetTypes.html#Boresight">Boresight</a>: the current position of the boresight on the instrument.	<p>	<li><b>Focus</b>: focus offset for the secondary mirror, as set by the guider or user.	<li><b>Scale</b>: scale factor for primary and secondary mirror, as set by the guider or user.	<li><b>Guiding</b>: the state of guiding.</ul><p><a name="Misc">The third panel shows miscellaneous information:<ul>	<li><b>HA</b>: hour angle of the object	<li><b>Design HA</b>: hour angle for which the plate was designed (blank if not relevant or if the cartridge and plate information from the platedb does not match the information from the guider).	<li><b>Des-Curr HA</b>: plate design hour angle - current hour angle	<li><b>TAI</b>: international atomic time	<p>	<li><b>Airmass</b>	<li><b>ZD</b>: zenith distance	<li><b>LMST</b>: local mean sidereal time at the observatory	<p>	<li><b>Inst</b>: name of current instrument, as set by the TCC's set instrument command and reported by the TCC.	<li><b>Inst ID</b>: instrument ID from the instrument ID switches, as reported by the MCP. If the switches do not give a consistent reading then Invalid is reported in red. If the instrument is a cartridge then its number is shown; otherwise the instrument name is shown (e.g. Eng Cam).	<p>The following entries come from the guider. They are blank if the MCP reports something other than a cartridge is loaded. They are red if the MCP reports that a different cartridge is loaded. They are blue if the MCP does not know what is loaded (proceed with caution).	<li><b>Cartridge</b>: cartridge ID, as reported by the guider.	<li><b>Plate</b>: plate ID, as reported by the guider.    <li><b>Pointing</b>: which pointing on the plate is used, as reported by the guider.</ul><p><a name="Axis"></a>The penultimate panel shows the position and status of the various axes: azimuth, altitude and (if present) instrument rotator. For each axis:<ul>	<li><b>Position</b>: the current position as reported by the axis controllers.	<li><b>TCC Status</b>: what the TCC thinks the axis is doing.	<li><b>TCC Error Code</b>: if the TCC has halted the axis, why it did so.	<li><b>Axis Controller Status</b>: state of axis controller; blank if OK. If the axis controller is reporting multiple problems (i.e. has set multiple bits set in its status word) then only the most important condition is reported.</ul><p><a name="StatusBar"></a>The bottom panel shows brief help. Use the Help item in the contextual menu of a control for more detailed help.</body></html>

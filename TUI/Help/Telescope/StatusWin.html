<h2><a href="../index.html">STUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Telescope</a>:StatusWin</h2>

<p>The Status window shows the status of the telescope and (on unix and Windows) contains STUI's menus. This window cannot be closed. Items in the various menus are described <a href="../index.html">here</a>.

<p><a name="NetPos"></a>The top panel shows user-specified information about the current target and also the progress of slews:
<ul>
	<li><b>Name</b>: object name
	<li>Obj Pos1/2 (e.g. RA/Dec): net object position. including object and arc offsets.
	<li><b>CSys</b>: <a href="../Telescope/CoordSys.html">coordinate system</a>.
	<li><b>Rot</b>: user-specified rotator angle and <a href="../Telescope/RotTypes.html">type of rotation</a>.
</ul>


<p><a name="Offsets"></a>The next panel shows certain <a href="OffsetTypes.html">offsets</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Object Arc Off: the current <a href="OffsetTypes.html#ObjectArc">object arc offset</a>.
	<li>Object Arc Off X,Y: the current object arc offset rotated to instrument xy coordinates (this may vary if the field rotates).
	<li>Bore X,Y: the current position of the <a href="OffsetTypes.html#Boresight">boresight</a> on the instrument.
	<p>
	<li><b>Focus</b>: focus offset for the secondary mirror, as set by the user or guider.
	<li><b>Scale</b>: plate scale (((plate scale/nominal scale) - 1) * 1e6), as set by the user or guider.
	<li><b>Guiding</b>: the state of guiding.
</ul>

<p><a name="Misc"></a>The third panel shows miscellaneous information:
<ul>
	<li><b>HA</b>: hour angle of the object
	<li><b>Design HA</b>: hour angle for which the plate was designed (blank if not relevant or if the cartridge and plate information from the platedb does not match the information from the guider).
	<li><b>Des-Curr HA</b>: plate design hour angle - current hour angle
	<li><b>TAI</b>: international atomic date and time
	<p>
	<li><b>Airmass</b>
	<li><b>ZD</b>: zenith distance
	<li><b>LMST</b>: local mean sidereal time at the observatory
	<li><b>MJD</b>: SDSS's specialized MJD days: TAI MJD - 0.3 truncated down to an integer.
	<p>
	<li><b>Inst</b>: name of current instrument, as set by the TCC's set instrument command and reported by the TCC.
	<li><b>Cartridge</b>: cartridge ID, as reported by both the MCP and guider. If the MCP and guider agree then the agreed-upon value is shown. Otherwise:
	<ul>
	    <li>If the MCP thinks no cartridge is loaded or the engineering camera is loaded, then the guider's cartridge information is ignored and Plate and Pointing are blank.
	    <li>If the MCP does not know which cartridge is loaded, or the number it has disagrees with the guider, then both values are shown in red. Proceed with caution!
    </ul>	    
	<li><b>Plate</b>: plate ID, as reported by the guider. Blank if the MCP thinks no cartridge is loaded or the engineering camera is loaded.
    <li><b>Pointing</b>: which pointing on the plate is used, as reported by the guider. Blank if the MCP thinks no cartridge is loaded or the engineering camera is loaded.
</ul>

<p><a name="Axes"></a>The penultimate panel shows the position and status of the various axes: azimuth, altitude and (if present) instrument rotator. For each axis:
<ul>
	<li><b>Current Position</b>: the current position as reported by the axis controllers.
	<li><b>Target Position</b>: the target position (where the telescope should be after slewing to the object).
	<li><b>TCC Status</b>: what the TCC thinks the axis is doing.
	<li><b>TCC Error Code</b>: if the TCC has halted the axis, why it did so.
	<li><b>Axis Controller Status</b>: state of axis controller; blank if OK. If the axis controller is reporting multiple problems (i.e. has set multiple bits set in its status word) then only the most important condition is reported.
</ul>

<p><a name="StatusBar"></a>The bottom panel shows brief help. Use the Help item in the contextual menu of a control for more detailed help.

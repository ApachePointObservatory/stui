It is primarily intended to allow Echelle users to manually guide.<p>The controls are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="OffType"></a><b>Offset type</b>: one of "Object", "Object XY", "Boresight", "Guide" or "Guide XY".	<ul>		<li>"Guide XY" guiding corrections conveniently rotated to line up with your slitviewer images. This is the default and is what you use for manual guiding.		<li>"Guide" offsets are for purists who prefer to work directly in az/alt.		<li>"Object", "Object XY" and "Boresight" offsets are <b>not</b> appropriate for manual guiding and probably not appropriate for a nudger at all. They are discussed under <a href="OffsetTypes.html">Offset Types</a> and also under <a href="OffsetWin.html#ObjOrBore">"object or boresight?"</a> in the help for the Offset window.	</ul>		<li><a name="MaxOff"></a><b>Max offset</b>: the maximum offset you can command using the graphical nudger to the right.		<li><a name="OffAmt"></a><b>Offset amount</b>: the amount of the current or most recent offset.	<li><a name="Canvas"><b>Graphical nudger</b>: command the offset using the square region to the right:	<ul>		<li>Click to select an amount to offset. Drag the mouse to change the amount.				<li>Release the mouse button to apply the offset.				<li>To cancel (without moving the telescope) drag the mouse outside the square before releasing the mouse button. (The arrow should disappear.)	</ul>	<li><a name="StatusWdg"></a><b>Status Bar</b> the status bar along the bottom displays help and the status of the last command.</ul></body></html>

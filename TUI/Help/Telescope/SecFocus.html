The value you set is an offset to the secondary mirror piston computed by the TCC. The TCC attempts to automatically compensate for the effects of changing temperature and altitude.<p>The controls are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="Focus"></a><b>Focus</b>: the current and requested secondary focus. A "!" will appear to the left of the requested value whenever it is different than the current value.		<li><a name="IncrWdg"></a><b>-50 and +50 buttons</b>: adjust the requested value by the stated amount. The mirror is not moved until you press the Apply button.		<li><a name="TimerWdg"></a><b>Countdown timer</b>: displays an estimate of the remaining move time. This timer is displayed whenever the mirror is moving, whether or not you initiated the move.		<li><a name="StatusWdg"></a><b>Status bar</b>: displays help and the status of the last command.		<li><a name="ApplyButton"></a><b>Apply button</b>: sends the requested focus to the TCC. This will move the secondary mirror, unless the telescope is not tracking or the requested focus is out of range. If you see a warning, the new value has been recorded but not applied.	<li><a name="CurrentButton"></a><b>Current button</b>: sets the requested value to the current value.</ul></body></html>

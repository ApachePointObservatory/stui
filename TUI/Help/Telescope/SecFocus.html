The seconary focus is actually an offset to the secondary mirror piston computed by the TCC (as it tries to compensate for changing temperature and altitude).<p>The controls are as follows:<ul>	<li><a name="Focus"></a><b>Focus</b>: the current focus. A countdown timer appears to the right of this when the secondary mirror is moving.		<li><a name="StatusWdg"></a><b>Status bar</b>: displays help and the status of the last command.		<li><a name="SetWdg"></a><b>Set...</b>: set a new secondary focus.		<li><a name="IncrWdg"></a><b>-<i>XX</i></b> and <b>+<i>XX</i></b> buttons: offset the secondary focus by the amount shown. The mirror is moved immediately.		<li><a name="DeltaWdg"></a><b><i>&Delta;</i></b> Menu (25/50/100): set the offset size for the -<i>XX</i> and +<i>XX</i> buttons.</ul></body></html>

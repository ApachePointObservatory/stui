These instructions work on MacOS X 10.3 and probably 10.4 but not earlier versions. Note: if you want to build an X11-based TUI for MacOS X, follow the instructions for <a href="Installation.html#Unix">installation on unix</a> instead.<p>Start by installing all necessary files.<ul>	<li>Download and install the current Aqua Tcl/Tk (8.4.11 as of this writing; do <b>not</b> use earlier versions). Mac binary installers are available from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/">ActiveState</a>.		<li>If you are on MacOS 10.3, download and install the appropriate _tkinter from <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">Mac OS X Python Packages</a>.		<li>Download the <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/index.html">Snack Sound Toolkit</a>. Aqua Tcl/Tk already installed the snack binaries, but you still have to install the python interface. Read the docs in .../snack&lt;vers&gt;/python.	<li>Make sure your new Python and Tkinter got correctly installed:<pre>% pythonPython ???  # is this the new version you just installed?...&gt;&gt;&gt;import Tkinter  # if this and the next step both work then Tkinter is properly installed&gt;&gt;&gt;root = Tkinter.Tk()  # you should see a new empty window</pre>	<li>Install the following python packages. You may be able to get binary installers from <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">Mac OS X Python Packages</a>. Otherwise install from source.	<ul>		<li><a href="http://numeric.scipy.org/">Numeric</a>		<li><a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray">numarray</a>		<li><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> (PIL). If you have to build this from source, be sure to follow the instructions and install the extra libraries it requires.	</ul>		<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits">pyfits</a>. Installation consists of copying pyfits.py into Python's site-packages directory, which you can locate using:<pre>% python&gt;&gt;&gt;import sys&gt;&gt;&gt;sys.path</pre>	<p>Then change the file ownership and permissions of pyfits.py to match the other files in site-packages.		<li>Download and install <a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">ds9</a>. The Mac version includes xpa last I checked; if this has changed, also install xpa (see links on ds9 page).	<li>Download <a href="http://tycho.apo.nmsu.edu:81/TUI-images">TUI</a> and unpack in some convenient root directory (called <i>tui_root</i> below). In other words, <i>tui_root</i> should contain the directories TUI, RO, etc.</ul><p>Now test your installation and fix any errors if TUI fails to run.<ul>	<li>Open the terminal	<li>% cd <i>tui_root</i>	<li>% python runtui.py</ul><p>Finally, build the TUI mac application.<ul>	<li>Open the terminal	<li>% cd <i>tui_root</i>/BuildForMac	<li>% ./buildtui.py	<li>Ignore warnings about missing modules and submodules (though if you get more than a dozen of these you may have a problem).	<li>At the end you should have a double-clickable application named "TUI <i>version</i>".	<li>Test the application by opening the console (run /Applications/Utilities/Console) and watching it as you run the application. It may help to clear the console's display first.	<li>Move the application to your /Applications folder or wherever you like.	<li>The application you built is self-contained and should work on anybody else's Mac.</ul></body></html>

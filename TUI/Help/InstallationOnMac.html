<h2><a href="index.html">STUI</a>:Building STUI from Source On MacOS X</h2>

<p>This document is for people who wish to run STUI from source on MacOS X (instead of using the Mac binary application) or who wish to build a Mac binary. Running STUI from source is very helpful if you developing code for STUI.

<p>Warning: this is an obscure document and some instructions may be out of date.

<p>There are two basic steps:
<ul>
    <li>Install STUI source and get it running. This is described below.
    <li>Build the Mac binary application (optional). For instructions see the ReadMe file in 
    the BuildForMac directory of your STUI source.
</ul>

<h3>Install STUI Source</h3>

<p>Follow the instructions for <a href="Installation.html#Unix">unix installation</a>, but with these refinements:

<ul>
	<li>I recommend you install <a href="http://www.python.org/download/download_mac.html">python.org python 2.x for MacOS X 10.6 and later</a>. You are unlikely to be happy with the older 10.3 version. Apple's built-in Python will work, but will be older and requires you to install packages in your system python, which is not recommended. Also, if you build a binary from source that uses Apple Python, python will not be included in the binary, which means the package will only work on one version of MacOS X.
	
	<li>Different python packages need to be installed in different ways. Try things in this order:
	<ul>
	    <li>For simple packages "pip install" may be all you need. You can get pip from PyPI.
	    <li>For complex packages (including numpy, matplolib, pygame and PIL) first look for a binary installer at the official site for that package. If not found, then I may have one in <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/rowen/python/">my repository</a>.
	</ul>

	<li>Aqua Tcl/Tk Mac binary installers are available from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/">ActiveState</a>. I have found that Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.5.11 works very well with STUI, whereas 8.5.12, 8.5.12.1 and 8.5.13 all cause crashes. I have not tested versions later than 8.5.13. Contact me if you need a binary installer for Tcl/Tk 8.5.11. 
	
	<li><a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">ds9</a>. The application is straighforward to install, but xpa is supplied as compiled command-line executables. Use Terminal to manually copy the executables to /usr/local/bin (which must be on your $PATH).
</ul>

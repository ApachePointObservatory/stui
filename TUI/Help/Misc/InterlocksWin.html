<h2><a href="../index.html">STUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Misc</a>:Interlocks Window</h2>

<p>Display system interlocks.

<p>You may click on an interlock button (red or green square) to bring up more information about it.

<p>Various other windows can be opened using the pop-up menu at the lower corner of the Interlocks window:
<ul>
    <li>All Interlocks: a list of every interlock and its current state. You can get help on this window by pressing the Help button along the bottom.
    <li>System Status: brings up a "cartoon" of the system; this is a very efficient way to display the state of each interlock, but the items are not labelled.
    <li>Ignored Interlocks: I'm not sure what this does.
</ul>

<p>Note: this window and its subwindows are taken directly from the old SDSS control system. As such, they have a different look and feel than normal STUI windows.

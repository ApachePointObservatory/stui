Press a button to immediately toggle the state of the associated lamp. A "!" will be displayed until the lamp has changed state.<p><b>Warning</b>: as of 2004-10-01, there are multiple ways to control the truss lamps that do <b>not</b> communicate with each other. As a result, the displayed state in the Truss Lamps window may be <b>wrong</b>. This is <a href="http://pod.apo.nmsu.edu/PRs?database=APO&amp;cmd=view+audit-trail&amp;pr=63">PR 63</a> and will be fixed at APO.<p>Notes:<ul>	<li>If the lamp controls say "Rebooting" then you should wait until the tlamps controller finishes rebooting.	<li>If a lamp control says "Unknown", you can still try to toggle the lamp, but it is likely that the lamp controller needs some help.</ul></body></html>

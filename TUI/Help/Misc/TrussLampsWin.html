Press a button to immediately toggle the state of the associated lamp. The control background color will change to pink (or the "Bad Background" preference) until the lamp has changed state.<p><b>Warning:</b> as of 2005-01 there are still multiple ways to control the truss lamps, and they do <b>not</b> communicate with each other. So if you want to use TUI to monitor or control the truss lamps, <b>make sure that all users control the lamps via TUI!</b> Otherwise:<ul>	<li>The displayed lamp state will be <b>wrong</b>.	<li>Non-TUI lamp commands block TUI access for a period of time (something has to time out before TUI has control again, and even then, the displayed state will be wrong).</ul><p>This is <a href="http://pod.apo.nmsu.edu/PRs?database=APO&amp;cmd=view+audit-trail&amp;pr=63">PR 63</a> and should be fixed at APO some day.<p>Notes:<ul>	<li>If the lamp controls say "Rebooting" then you should wait until the tlamps controller finishes rebooting.	<li>If a lamp control says "Unknown", you can still try to toggle the lamp, but it is likely that the lamp controller needs some help.</ul></body></html>

<h2><a href="../index.html">STUI</a>:<a href="index.html">Scripts</a>:STUIAdditions</h2>

<p>STUI will look in two separate "STUIAdditions" directories for user scripts and extra STUI window code. One of these is for your private additions, the other is for additions shared with other users on the computer.

<p>Scripts for the Scripts menu belong in a directory named Scripts in the STUIAdditions directory. For more information see <a href="../Scripts/ScriptingManual.html#WhereToPutScripts">Where To Put Scripts</a> in the <a href="../Scripts/ScriptingManual.html">Scripting Manual</a>.

<p>Code to generate additional STUI windows can be put directly in a STUIAdditions directory. Writing such additions is described in the <a href="../Scripts/Programming.html">Programming</a> guide.

<h3>The location of STUIAdditions</h3>

<p>STUI looks for a directory named STUIAdditions in each of two locations: one unique to each user, the other shared by all users on a multi-user system.

<p>Both STUIAdditions directories are optional and are not present by default. You can create the user version yourself. You may need special privileges to create the shared version.

<p>The locations depend on which platform you are using:

<ul>
	<li>unix: <code>~</code> (your home directory) and <i>TUIRoot</i> (the parent directory for STUI). STUIAdditions may be a symbolic link.
	<li>MacOS X: the private and shared application support directories. On US systems this is <code>/Users/<i>username</i>/Library/Application Support</code> and <code>/Library/Application Support</code>. STUIAdditions may be a symbolic link but it must not be an alias.
	<li>Windows: the private and shared application data directory. On US systems this is <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data</code> and <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>All Users</i>\Application Data</code>. STUIAdditions must not be an alias.
</ul>

<p>In general, additions present in the user STUIAdditions directory mask identically named additions in the shared STUIAdditions directory, and both mask identically named built-in scripts and windows. Thus you should be a bit careful in naming additions. This is discussed in more detail in the <a href="ScriptingManual.html#MoreInformation">scripting</a> and <a href="Programming.html#WhereToPutYourCode">programming</a> manuals.

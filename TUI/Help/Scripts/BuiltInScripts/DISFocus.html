<p>The DIS:Focus script allows to you take a series of exposures over a range of secondary mirror focus values, reports the resulting FWHMs and optionally adjusts the focus to the estimated best value.

<p>The sequence is:
<ul>
	<li>The script moves the boresight so the focus star is visible next to the slit.
	<li>The script takes an exposure (at the current focus) to verify there's a usable star. Note that the FWHM of this star is ignored; this first image just helps with acquisition.
	<li>The script pauses, allowing you to do things such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Find a rough initial focus (using the Echelle Slitviewer and the Secondary Focus windows, <b>not</b> the script window).
		<li>Adjust the focus parameters. Be sure to do this after you've achieved a rough initial focus to avoid wasting your time sampling the wrong focus range.
		<li>Adjust the exposure time and/or centroid radius.
	</ul>
	<li>When you are ready to continue, press the Resume button. The script then runs to completion...
	<li>The script takes a sequence of exposures at varying focus, measuring FWHM of the star at each focus. If the FWHM cannot be measured, it is reported as NaN.
	<li>The script fits the resulting FWHMs to a parabola to find the best focus.
	<li>If "Move to Best Focus" is checked, the script sets the focus to the best-fit focus (if one was found) and takes another exposure.
	<li>At the end, the script always restores the boresight to its original position (even if you abort the script or it fails).
</ul>

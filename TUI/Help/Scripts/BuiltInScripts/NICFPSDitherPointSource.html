<h2><a href="../../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="../index.html">Scripts</a>:<a href="index.html">Built In Scripts</a>:NICFPS:Dither:Point Source</h2>

<p>The NICFPS:Dither:Point Source script allows you to take a sequence of exposures in a square pattern plus a point in the middle. This pattern is typically used for point sources.
	
<p>The sequence is to take <b>#Exp</b> exposures at each dither point before moving on to the next. The dither point order is shown as a number to the left of each checkbox.

<p>Controls include:
<ul>
    <li>A checkbox for each dither point. Uncheck the box (before the script starts) to skip the point.
    <li><b>Box Size</b>: the size of one side of the square pattern, in arcseconds on the sky.
</ul>

<p>The input controls are ignored once the script starts (as usual for scripts).

<p>As the script runs the status of each dither point is updated. This status is retained when the script ends so you can see what happened. It is cleared when you start a new run.

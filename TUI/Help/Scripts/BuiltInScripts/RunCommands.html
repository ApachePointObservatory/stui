<h2><a href="../../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="../index.html">Scripts</a>:<a href="index.html">Built In Scripts</a>:Run_Commands</h2>

<p>Run a set of commands, one at a time. Each command runs to completion before the next command is executed. If any command fails, the script aborts. You may save your commands to a file and retrieve them again later.

<p>The results of the commands do not show up in the Run_Commands window. If you can't see what you want in TCC's various displays then open the <a href="../../TUIMenu/LogWin.html">Log Window</a>

<h3><a name="CommandsFormat">Commands Format</a></h3>

<p>Each line must be one of:
<ul>
	<li>A command, in the form: <i>actor command</i>
	<li>A blank line (ignored)
	<li>A comment starting with # (ignored)
</ul>

<p>Example:<pre>
# sample commands that are safe to run
tcc show status
tcc show time
</pre>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The file bar cross the top
	<ul>
		<li><b>File Menu:</b>: the usual Open&hellip;, Save&hellip and Save As&hellip menu options.
		<li><b>Current file</b> a field showing the name of the current file (if any).
	</ul>
	<li><b>Commands area:</b> the commands to execute. The currently executing command is highlighted (and remains highlighted if the script aborts or is cancelled.)
	<li>The rest of the window shows the usual script status bars and controls.
</ul>

<h3>Caveat</h3>

<p>Run_Commands provides a simple way of running a fixed set of commands. It is very easy to use, but also very limited. If you find yourself wanting more control or flexibility then I encourage you to <a href="../ScriptingTutorial/index.html">write your own script</a>.

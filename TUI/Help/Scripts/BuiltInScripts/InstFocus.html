<h2><a href="../../index.html">TUI</a>:<a href="../index.html">Scripts</a>:<a href="index.html">Built In Scripts</a>:<i>Inst</i>:Focus</h2>

<p>The various <i>Inst</i>:Focus scripts allows to you take a series of exposures over a range of secondary mirror focus values, report the resulting FWHMs and optionally adjust the focus to the estimated best value.

<p>The script differs somewhat for slitviewers and other imagers in that:
<ul>
	<li>Slitviewers assume the star is on the boresight, so user cannot set the star position but can set a boresight offset.The script starts out by moving the boresight off the slit and ends by restoring the original boresight.
	<li>Other imagers simply take an image and choose the best star. You can change the star position if you don't like the automatic choice.
</ul>

<p>The scripts runs in three phases:

<h3>Start Phase</h3>

<p>Slitviewers:
<blockquote>
<p>The script moves the boresight so the focus star is visible next to the slit, sets the focus to Center Focus, takes an exposure and tries to measure the star's FWHM. It then pauses, allowing you to make corrections before starting the focus sweep.

<p>You may modify focus or exposure time and take another exposure by pressing <b>Measure</b>. You may also tweak up the pointing, e.g. by control-clicking the star.
</blockquote>

<p>Other Imagers:
<blockquote>
<p>The Start button just enables Find, Measure and Sweep. You must enter a suitable star position and other parameters before pressing Sweep. The Find and Measure buttons can help you set the parameters.
<ul>
	<li><b>Find</b> sets focus to Center Focus, takes an exposure and tries to find a suitable star.
	<p><b>Always confirm the star by eye, especially for NICFPS.</b> You must be especially careful not to pick a star that will saturate for NICFPS and it's not easy for the script to avoid these.
	<li><b>Measure</b> sets focus to Center Focus, takes an exposure and centroid at the currently specified star position.
</ul>

<p>Once you are happy with the star and parameters, press <b>Sweep</b> to initiate the focus sweep.
</blockquote>

<h3>Focus Sweep</h3>

<p>Press <b>Sweep</b> to start a focus sweep: the script measures the star's FWHM over the specified range of focus values. During a sweep changing the parameters has no effect.

<p>Once the sweep is finished, the script fits a best focus and sanity-checks the fit (halting with an error the fit is unsuitable). These tests are simplistic (especially if there are only three valid measurements, in which case you get a warning that standard deviation cannot be computed).
<blockquote>
<b>Always examine the data and judge the results for yourself.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>If <b>Move to Best Focus</b> is checked and the fit is acceptable, the script moves to that focus and takes a final measurement of FWHM.

<h3>End</h3>

<p>At the end for slitviewers the script <i>always</i> restores the boresight to its original position, even if the script fails or is aborted. (Only slitviewers mess with the boresight.)

<p>After a sweep the Central Focus is restored unless the sweep set a new best focus. (If you stop the script before a sweep is done then focus is left where it is.)

<p>The GRIM:Square script allows you to take a sequence of exposures in a square pattern plus a point in the middle.
	
<p>The requested number of exposures is taken at each point before moving on to the next point. The points are only cycled through once. Any point can be skipped by unchecking the appropriate checkbox (e.g. to skip a dead quadrant).

<p>The checkboxes for the points to observer are the only controls that are read while the script runs. If you uncheck one of those checkboxes before the script gets to that point, it will skip that point. For all other controls you must restart the script for changes to take effect.

<p>The NICFPS:Focus script allows to you take a series of exposures over a range of secondary mirror focus values and automatically determines the best focus.

<p>Warning: this script requires matplotlib (a python extension). Matplotlib is included in the Mac and Windows versions, but not the unix source code version.

<form>
<ul>
	<li><b>Time:</b> the exposure time.
	<li><b>#Exp</b>: the number of exposures at each focus position. 1 is recommended.
	<li><b>Name</b>: the file name.
	<li>Comment: a comment for the FITS header.
	<li><b>Star Position</b>: position of star on detector; typically 512, 512.
	<li><b>Start Focus</b>: initial secondary focus
	<li><b>End Focus</b>: final secondary focus
	<li><b>Focus Positions</b>: the number of focus positions to try
	<li><b>Focus Increment</b>: (output) focus increment per step
	<li><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><b>Move to Best Focus</b>: if checked, move to the estimated best focus and measure the FWHM at that focus.
	<li><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><b>Plot FWHM</b>: when finished, plot FWHM as a function of secondary focus?
	<li><b>Estimated Focus</b>: (output) best focus value and estimated FWHM at that focus.
	<li><b>Final Focus</b>: (output) best focus value and <b>measured</b> FWHM at that focus (blank if Move to Best Focus not checked).

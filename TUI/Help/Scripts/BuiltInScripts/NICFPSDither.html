<p>The NICFPS:Dither:Point Source script allows you to take a sequence of exposures in a square pattern plus a point in the middle. This pattern is typically used for point sources.
	
<p>The requested number of exposures is taken at each point before moving on to the next point. The points are only cycled through once. Any point can be skipped by unchecking the appropriate checkbox.

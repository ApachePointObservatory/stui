<p>Warning: this script is very preliminary (just a simple copy of the GRIM:Square script). It will certainly be modified as the requirements become clearer. In particular, the pattern of points may change and the option to skip a quadrant may be eliminated.

<p>The NICFPS:Dither script allows you to take a sequence of exposures in a square pattern plus a point in the middle.
	
<p>The requested number of exposures is taken at each point before moving on to the next point. The points are only cycled through once. Any point can be skipped by unchecking the appropriate checkbox.

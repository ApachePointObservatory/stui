<h2>Refinements</h2>

<p>Adding a few refinements to the ping script makes a script worth adapting for your own uses.

<p>The improvements are as follows:

<ul>
	<li>Displays a log of the results of each command.
	<li>It checks all actors in the list, even if a command fails.
</ul>

<p>The resulting script still has no provision for user input, but often that is fine. We'll deal with user input in the <a href="UserInput.html">next lesson</a>.

<p>Notes:
<ul>
	<li>This is the first script that displays any widgets. In this case it is just one widget, and one that is smart enough to take care of its own display. But the pattern is always the same:
	<ul>
		<li>Use "sr.master" as the master widget. This is an empty frame intended for your script's widgets. It appears above the status bar and control buttons.
		<li>Grid or pack widgets to make them show up. Never mix gridding and packing in the same master widget; it usually causes Tk to go into an infinite loop.
		<li>To pass data between <code>__init__</code> and <code>run</code>, use <code>self</code>, as in <code>self.actorCmdList</code> and <code>self.logWdg</code>.
	</ul>
    <li>The list of command is defined in __init__ simply because it is used to set the height of the log window to avoid any need to scroll. however, if the number of commands gets too large (such that the window gets too long) then you should think about a more efficient way to display the information, or accept the need to scroll and set height to a constant, such as 20.
    <li>The result of yield sr.wait... is saved in sr.value. In particular, yield sr.waitCmd puts the command variable (opscore.actor.CmdVar) in sr.value. You can test a command variable to see if the command succeeded or failed (as shown above), access keyword variables that were set in response to the command (see the keyVars argument to waitCmd for details).
</ul>

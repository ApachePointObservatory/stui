<h2>Get Info</h2>

<p>It is easy to incorporate information from an instrument or the telescope into your scripts. Most information you might want is available in various "models" within TUI. These include a model for each instrument (TUI.Inst.DIS.DISModel, etc.), a telescope model (TUI.TCC.TCCModel) and the exposure models you have already seen (TUI.Inst.ExposeModel).

<p>Most models primarily consist of a set of "keyword variables", one per keyword that instrument outputs. Keyword variables may be read using sr.getKeyVar or sr.waitKeyVar. Models often also include a few constants, preferences and/or convenience functions (such as <code>formatExpCmd</code>). To obtain a model, import the appropriate code and call <code>getModel()</code> as per the example here. To find out what is in a model, I suggest you read its code. (There are also good ways to get help from within Python; see the <a href="../Programming.html">Programming manual</a> for details.)

<p>Note that the telescope model contains some important of information about the current instrument, including its name, image scale and size&mdash;all information that is <b>not</b> available from the instrument model.

<p>The following example shows a good use of querying information. DIS always does something when you ask its motors to move, even if they are already in the right place. In particular, the gratings are always homed, which is very slow, and the turret detent is temporarily retracted. In the following example, current DIS status is queried and only items that need to be changed are moved.

<p>Note that whenever you read input, you need to think about debug mode (because in that mode you only get None back). In this case, if we're in debug mode then we don't check that the current instrument is DIS. In this example we don't have to mess with the getKeyVar statements because getKeyVar returns None in debug mode, making the commands run, which is perfect.

<h2>DISConfig script</h2>

<h3>Be sure you have permission to use DIS before running this example!!!</h3>

<p>Comments:
<ul>
	<li><code>sr.getKeyVar</code> returns the current value of the specified "keyword variable" without waiting. If you prefer to wait (e.g. to get the next value or to make sure there is a valid value) then use <code>yield sr.waitKeyVar</code> instead. Note that sr.wait functions return values in sr.value (because there's no other way when using yield); thus, for example:
	<pre>
	yield sr.waitKeyVar(disModel.cmdLambdas, ind=0)
	blambda = sr.value
	</pre>
</ul>

<h2>Get Info</h2>

<p>It is easy to incorporate information from an actor (e.g. instrument or the tcc) into your scripts. Each actor has a model that contains a set of keyword variables you can query. In this simple example we get and display the version of several actors.

<p>The models are in the actorkeys product. You should get a copy of actorkeys (or browse it on the Trac wiki) before trying to read data from an instrument. Each model contains a description of each keyword output by the actor (at least those keywords you can get data for) and the description usually includes documentation. (One exception: documentation for TCC keywords is in the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/Telescopes/TCC/MessageKeywords.html">TCC Message Keywords Dictionary</a>).

<p>Notes:
<ul>
	<li><code>sr.getKeyVar</code> returns the current value of the specified "keyword variable" without waiting. That is fully appropriate for this script, because the hub gets the version and status from every actor when it connects (and the status is updated as it changes). Thus you should never have to send an explicit status command unless you suspect the actor is broken in such a way that it is not reliably outputting status as it changes. There are, however, other techniques to get information, which are appropriate to other situations:
	<ul>
	    <li>Sometimes you want to wait until the keyword is next updated. In that case use <code>yield sr.waitKeyVar</code>.
	    <li>Sometimes you need the value of a keyword <b>in response to a particular command</b>. For example suppose you are converting a position from one coordinate system to another using the "tcc convert" command. In that case you want to the keywords output by "tcc convert" in response to your particular command, with no chance of mixing them up with a reply to somebody else's command. A less convincing example is shown in this script. The TCC does not yet have a dedicated keyword for version, but uses the generic "text" keyword. A reliable way to get the version is shown in the script. The technique is the same in any case: supply the keywords you want to watch as the keyVars argument to sr.waitCmd, then obtain the data using CmdVar's getLastKeyVarData or getKeyVarData calls.

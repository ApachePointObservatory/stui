<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You have seen how to write a variety of scripts, including scripts that use current status information from instruments and the telescope and that add widgets for user input and output. Now what?

<ul>
	<li>Write some scripts! Nothing beats experience, and scripts can save you precious observing time.

	<li>Read the <a href="../ScriptingManual.html">Scripting Manual</a>. It tells you where to put your scripts so they are automatically loaded. It also includes a detailed reference for the script runner <code>sr</code> and describes the <code>end</code> function which your script can use to reliably clean up after itself.

	<li>Look through existing scripts and perhaps existing TUI code.

	<li>Look through <a href="../Programming.html">Programming</a>. It gives you an overview of what is going on "under the hood" in TUI and helps you learn more. It also describes how to create your own TUI windows and where to put them so they load automatically. Writing your own TUI windows is not hard, once you have written some scripts.
</ul>

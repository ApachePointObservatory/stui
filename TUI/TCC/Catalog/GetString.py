def getString(astr, begInd=0):
    """
Extracts a delimited string value.
Strings are delimited with a pair of single or double quotes.
Embedded singles of whichever delimiter is NOT used are ignored,
as are the following character pairs: \" \' "" ''

Inputs:
    astr: the string to parse
    begInd: the starting index; must point to a single or double quote
        that is the beginning of the string value. Leading white space
        is NOT ignored.
Returns a duple consisting of:
    a single string, excluding delimiters
    the index of the next non-whitespace character, or None if end-of-string

Exceptions:
    if the initial character is not an allowed string delimiter (single
        or double quote) raises a SyntaxError
    if begInd > len(astr) raises an IndexError

History:
2003-06-25 ROwen    From RO.ParseMsg.GetString
2004-05-18 ROwen    Removed unused local variable quoteInd.
                    Fixed test code to now use 'str' as a variable.

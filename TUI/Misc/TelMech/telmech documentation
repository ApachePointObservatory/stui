Type telmech plus one of the followingcommands.  Each command configures a device state.  Most commandscan take the first few unique characters of a name.  If the charactersdo not uniquely select the part, then you will get an error.Commands:     ? - print commands     tertrot - set tertiary to this port         usage: tertrot portname             portname is one of the ports or home to home the  tertiary rotation     eyelid - set the eyelid state for a single eyelid or ALL eyelids         usage: eyelid port state             state is either open or close             eyelid is one of the eyelid names or ALL     cover - open or close the covers         usage: cover state             state is either open or close     light - turn on/off lights         usage: light light1 [light2 [...]] state         light1, light2, ... are the light names or ALL         state is on or off     fan  - turn on/off fans         usage: fan fan1 [fan2 [...]] state         fan1, fan2, ... are the fan names or ALL         state is on or off     louver - open/close louvers         usage: louver louver1 [louver2 [...]] state         louver1, louver2, ... are the louver names or ALL         state is on or off     status [device]         device is one of the devices above, i.e. tertrot, eyelid,  cover, light,         fan, and louverFor example:tui> telmech ?     should printout telmech commandstui> telmech eyelid     should print out the usage and list the ports which can be settui> telmech light incan on     should turn on incandescents on the observing levelTo Be Done:     The m3 hardware status is not used in this version.  So, moving     the tertiary, opening/closing eyelids, etc., do not have  feedback if the     move was successful or not.  A lot more work is needed to make this     more robust.     The commands are going through the tcc.  In future versions, the  tcc     should be taken out of the middle and the commands should go  directly     to the controllers.     Identify missing commands.  One that comes to mind is to be able     to have status as one of the options to a device command.  For  example,         telmech fan status     But, for the meantime, just use         telmech status fan</x-flowed>

"""An object that models the current state of the truss lamps.

It contains instance variables that are KeyVariables
or sets of KeyVariables. Most of these are directly associated
with status keywords and a few are ones that I generate.

Thus it is relatively easy to get the current value of a parameter
and it is trivial to register callbacks for when values change
or register ROWdg widgets to automatically display updating values.

"""Telescope User Interface.
This is the main routine that calls everything else.

2003-02-27 ROwen    First version with history.
                    Modified to use the new Hub authorization
2003-03-20 ROwen    Added DIS
2003-03-25 ROwen    Moved TCC widgets into TCC subdirectory;
    modified to load TUI windows from TUIWindow.py
    and to auto-load windows from TCC, Inst and Misc directories
2003-04-04 ROwen    Fixed auto-load code to be platform-independent.
2003-04-22 ROwen    Modified to not auto-load window modules
                    whose file name begins with ".".
2003-06-09 ROwen    Modified to use TUIModel.
2003-06-18 ROwen    Modified to print a full traceback for unexpected errors;
                    modified to exclude SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
                    when testing for general exceptions.
2003-12-17 ROwen    Modified to auto load windows from all of the
                    TCC package (instead of specific sub-packages)
                    and also from TUISharedAdditions and TUIUserAdditions.
2004-01-23 ROwen    Modified to not rely on modules being loaded from the
                    same dir as this file. This simplifies generating a
                    Mac standalone app.
                    Modified to load *all* windows in TUI,
                    rather than searching specific directories.
                    Improved error handling of loadWindows:
                    - if TUI cannot be loaded, fail
                    - reject module names with "." in them
                    (both changes help debug problems with making
                    standalone apps).
2004-02-05 ROwen    Changed the algorithm for finding user additions.
2004-02-06 ROwen    Adapted to RO.OS.walkDirs->RO.OS.findFiles.
2004-02-17 ROwen    Changed to call buildMenus instead of buildAutoMenus
                    in the "None.Status" toplevel. .
2004-03-03 ROwen    Modified to print the version number during startup.
2004-03-09 ROwen    Bug fix: unix code was broken.
2004-05-17 ROwen    Modified to be runnable by an external script (e.g. runtui.py).
                    Modified to print version to log rather than stdout.
2004-07-09 ROwen    Modified to use TUI.TUIPaths
2004-10-06 ROwen    Modified to use TUI.MenuBar.
2005-06-16 ROwen    Modified to use improved KeyDispatcher.logMsg.
2005-07-22 ROwen    Modified to hide tk's console window if present.
2005-08-01 ROwen    Modified to use TUI.LoadStdModules, a step towards
                    allowing TUI code to be run from a zip file.
2005-08-08 ROwen    Moved loadWindows and findWindowsModules to WindowModuleUtil.py
2005-09-22 ROwen    Modified to use TUI.TUIPaths.getAddPaths instead of getTUIPaths.
2006-10-25 ROwen    Modified to not send dispatcher to BackgroundTasks.
2007-01-22 ROwen    Modified to make sure sys.executable is absolute,
                    as required for use with pyinstaller 1.3.

"""Play each of the standard sounds for TUI.

Gets the sounds from TUI preferences.

2003-04-28 ROwen    Minimal implementation.
2003-10-30 ROwen    Added msgReceived.
2003-11-24 ROwen    Moved to TUI.Sounds; changed to use sound prefs.
2003-12-03 ROwen    Added exposureBegins, exposureEnds, guidingBegins, guidingEnds. 
2003-12-09 ROwen    Modified to import TUI.Models.TUIModel when it's used; this
                    allows TUI.Sounds to be imported before TUI.Models.TUIModel.
2004-05-18 ROwen    Stopped importing RO.Wdg; it wasn't used.
2005-08-02 ROwen    Moved from Sounds/PlaySounds.py -> PlaySound.py
2006-04-14 ROwen    Added guideModeChanges.
2006-10-24 ROwen    Added logHighlightedText.
2009-07-23 ROwen    Added seriousAlert.

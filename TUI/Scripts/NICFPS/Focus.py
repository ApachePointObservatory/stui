"""Take a series of NICFPS exposures at different focus positions to estimate best focus.

To do:
- Fail unless NICFPS is in imaging mode and binned 1x1
  or put NICFPS into the required mode. To do the latter:
  - Override initAll to record the current mode and put into the correct mode.
  - Override end to restore the original mode.

History:
2005-04-30 SBeland	Copied/enhanced from NICFPS Dither script
2006-02-01 SBeland	Modified to use full window mode to try to avoid the persistence
					seen on the chip in window mode.
2006-04-24 ROwen	Modified to not use pylab.
					Graph windows are now normal TUI toplevels, so their position is remembered.
					Improved backlash compensation to use a constant amount of compensation
					and to apply for first focus move as well as final move to best focus.
					Changed OffsetWaitMS to FocusWaitMS.
					Changed to be a class, so requires TUI 1.2 or later.
					Added Default button and DefDeltaFoc constant.
					Added code to usefully run in debug mode.
					Warning: not tested talking to NICFPS.
2006-06-01 ROwen	Added Centroid Radius control.
					Added a log panel to output results.
2006-06-05 ROwen	Added matplotlib.use("TkAgg") and matplotlib.rcParams["numerix"] = "numarray"
					to avoid problems with user's configuration files.
					Fixed radius->cradius.
					Changed default radius from 50 to 20.
					Changed backlash compensation from 500um to 50um.
2006-09-27 ROwen	Changed to graph as data comes in.
					PR 451: graph only worked for the first execution.
2006-11-01 ROwen	Tweaked for the new RO.Wdg.LogWdg.
					Another fix for PR 451: graph only worked for the first execution.
2006-11-07 ROwen	Stopping the script during an exposure will now stop the exposure.
2006-11-09 ROwen	Removed any attempt to show images.
2006-12-11 ROwen	Modified to use TUI.Base.BaseFocusScript
2006-12-28 ROwen	Modified "to do" comments.
2006-01-12 ROwen	Added maxFindAmpl argument.

"""An object that models the current state of the Echelle.

It contains instance variables that are KeyVariables
or sets of KeyVariables. Most of these are directly associated
with status keywords and a few are ones that I generate.

Thus it is relatively easy to get the current value of a parameter
and it is trivial to register callbacks for when values change
or register ROWdg widgets to automatically display updating values.

2003-12-09 ROwen
2003-12-17 ROwen    Modified to refresh using refreshKeys and to use KeyVarFact.
2004-01-06 ROwen    Modified to use KeyVarFactory.setKeysRefreshCmd.
2004-05-18 ROwen    Stopped importing math and Tkinter; they weren't used.
2005-05-12 ROwen    Modified for new Echelle ICC.
2005-06-06 ROwen    Bug fix: curr filter keywords came before filter name list keywords
                    so the data was requested in the wrong order.
2005-06-10 ROwen    Added shutter keyword.

"""An object that models the current state of the Hub.

It contains instance variables that are KeyVariables
or sets of KeyVariables. Most of these are directly associated
with status keywords and a few are ones that I generate.

Thus it is relatively easy to get the current value of a parameter
and it is trivial to register callbacks for when values change
or register ROWdg widgets to automatically display updating values.
